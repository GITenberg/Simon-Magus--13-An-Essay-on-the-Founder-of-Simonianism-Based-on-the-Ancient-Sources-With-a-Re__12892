<h1>SIMON MAGUS.</h1>
<br />
<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<br />
<p>Everybody in Christendom has heard of Simon, the magician, and how
Peter, the apostle, rebuked him, as told in the narrative of the <i>Acts
of the Apostles</i>. Many also have heard the legend of how at Rome
this
wicked sorcerer endeavoured to fly by aid of the demons, and how Peter
caused him to fall headlong and thus miserably perish. And so most
think
that there is an end of the matter, and either cast their mite of pity
or contempt at the memory of Simon, or laugh at the whole matter as the
invention of superstition or the imagination of religious fanaticism,
according as their respective beliefs may be in orthodoxy or
materialism. This for the general. Students of theology and church
history, on the other hand, have had a more difficult task set them in
comparing and arranging the materials they have at their disposal, as
found in the patristic writings and legendary records; and various
theories have been put forward, not the least astonishing being the
supposition that Simon was an alias for Paul, and that the Simon and
Peter in the accounts of the fathers and in the narrative of the
legends
were simply concrete symbols to represent the two sides of the Pauline
and Petrine controversies.</p>
<p>The first reason why I have ventured on this present enquiry is that
Simon Magus is invariably mentioned by the heresiologists as the
founder
of the first heresy of the commonly-accepted Christian era, and is
believed by them to have been the originator of those systems of
religio-philosophy and theosophy which are now somewhat inaccurately
classed together under the heading of Gnosticism. And though this
assumption of the patristic heresiologists is entirely incorrect, as
may
be proved from their own works, it is nevertheless true that
Simonianism
is the first system that, as far as our present records go, came into
conflict with what has been regarded as the orthodox stream of
Christianity. A second reason is that I believe that Simon has been
grossly misrepresented, and entirely misunderstood, by his orthodox
opponents, whoever they were, in the first place, and also, in the
second place, by those who have ignorantly and without enquiry copied
from them. But my chief reason is that the present revival of
theosophical enquiry throws a flood of light on Simon's teachings,
whenever we can get anything approaching a first-hand statement of
them,
and shows that it was identical in its fundamentals with the Esoteric
Philosophy of all the great religions of the world.</p>
<p>In this enquiry, I shall have to be slightly wearisome to some of my
readers, for instead of giving a selection or even a paraphraze of the
notices on Simon which we have from authenticated patristic sources, I
shall furnish verbatim translations, and present a digest only of the
unauthenticated legends. The growth of the Simonian legend must unfold
itself before the reader in its native form as it comes from the pens
of
those who have constructed it. Repetitions will, therefore, be
unavoidable in the marshalling of authorities, but they will be shown
to
be not without interest in the subsequent treatment of the subject, and
at any rate we shall at least be on the sure ground of having before us
all that has been said on the matter by the Church fathers. Having
cited
these authorities, I shall attempt to submit them to a critical
examination, and so eliminate all accretions, hearsay and controversial
opinions, and thus sift out what reliable residue is possible. Finally,
my task will be to show that Simon taught a system of Theosophy, which
instead of deserving our condemnation should rather excite our
admiration, and that, instead of being a common impostor and impious
perverter of public morality, his method was in many respects of the
same nature as the methods of the theosophical movement of to-day, and
deserves the study and consideration of all students of Theosophy.<br />

<p>Now a certain fellow by name Simon had been previously in the city
practising magic and driving the people of Samaria out of their wits,
saying that he was some great one; to whom all from small to great gave
heed, saying: "This man is the Power of God which is called Great." And
they gave heed to him, owing to his having driven them out of their
wits for a long time by his magic arts. But when they believed on
Philip preaching about the Kingdom of God and the Name of Jesus Christ,
they began to be baptized, both men and women. And Simon himself also
believed, and after being baptized remained constantly with Philip; and
was driven out of <i>his</i> wits on seeing the signs and great wonders<a
 name="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> that
took place.</p>
<p> And the apostles in Jerusalem hearing that Samaria had received the
Word of God, sent Peter and John to them. And they went down and prayed
for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit. For as yet it had
not fallen upon any of them, but they had only been baptized unto the
Name of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p> Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy
Spirit. And when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given by the laying
on of the hands of the apostles, he offered them money, saying: "Give
unto me also this power, in order that on whomsoever I lay my hands he
may receive the Holy Spirit."</p>
<p> But Peter said unto him: "Thy silver perish with thee, in that thou
didst think that the gift of God is possessed with money. There is not
for thee part or lot in this Word, for thy heart is not right before
God. Therefore turn from this evil of thine, and pray the Lord, if by
chance the thought of thy heart shall be forgiven thee. For I see that
thou art in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity."</p>
<p> And Simon answered and said: "Pray ye on my behalf to the Lord,
that none of the things that ye have said may come upon me."</p>

<p>And thirdly, that even after the ascension of the Christ into heaven

worship him. And they speak of a certain Helen, who went round with him

<div class="blkquot">
<p>1. Simon was a Samaritan, the notorious magician of whom Luke the
disciple and adherent of the apostles says: "But there was a fellow by
name Simon, who had previously practised the art of magic in their
state, and led away the people of the Samaritans, saying that he was
some great one, to whom they all listened, from the small to the great,
saying: 'He is the Power of God, which is called Great.' Now they gave
heed to him because he had driven them out of their wits by his magical
phenomena." This Simon, therefore, pretended to be a believer, thinking
that the apostles also wrought their cures by magic and not by the
power of God; and supposing that their filling with the Holy Spirit by
the laying on of hands those who believed in God, through that Christ
Jesus who was being preached by them&#8212;that this was effected by some
superior magical knowledge, and offering money to the apostles, so that
he also might obtain the power of giving the Holy Spirit to whomsoever
he would, he received this answer from Peter: "Thy money perish with
thee, since thou hast thought that the gift of God is obtained
possession of with money; for thee there is neither part nor lot in
this Word, for thy heart is not right before God. For I see thou art in
the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity."</p>
<p> And since the magician still refused to believe in God, he
ambitiously strove to contend against the apostles, so that he also
might be thought of great renown, by extending his investigations into
universal magic still farther, so that he struck many aghast; so much
so that he is said to have been honoured with a statue for his magic
knowledge by Claudius C&aelig;sar.</p>
<p> He, therefore, was glorified by many as a god; and he taught that
it was he himself who, forsooth, appeared among the Jews as the Son,
while in Samaria he descended as the Father, and in the rest of the
nations he came as the Holy Spirit. That he was the highest power, to
wit, the Father over all, and that he allowed himself to be called by
whatever name men pleased.</p>
<p> 2. Now the sect of the Samaritan Simon, from whom all the heresies
took their origin, was composed of the following materials.</p>
<p> He took round with him a certain Helen, a hired prostitute from the
Phoenician city Tyre, after he had purchased her freedom, saying that
she was the first conception (or Thought) of his Mind, the Mother of
All, by whom in the beginning he conceived in his Mind the making of
the Angels and Archangels. That this Thought, leaping forth from him,
and knowing what was the will of her Father, descended to the lower
regions and generated the Angels and Powers, by whom also he said this
world was made. And after she had generated them, she was detained by
them through envy, for they did not wish to be thought to be the
progeny of any other. As for himself, he was entirely unknown by them;
and it was his Thought that was made prisoner by the Powers and Angels
that has been emanated by her. And she suffered every kind of indignity
at their hands, to prevent her re&auml;scending to her Father, even to
being imprisoned in the human body and transmigrating into other female
bodies, as from one vessel into another.<a name="FNanchor_7"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> She also was in that Helen, on
whose account the Trojan War arose; wherefore also Stesichorus<a
 name="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> was
deprived of his sight when he spake evil of her in his poems; and that
afterwards when he repented and wrote what is called a recantation, in
which he sang her praises, he recovered his sight. So she,
transmigrating from body to body, and thereby also continually
undergoing indignity, last of all even stood for hire in a brothel; and
she was the "lost sheep."</p>
<p> 3. Wherefore also he himself had come, to take her away for the
first time, and free her from her bonds, and also to guarantee
salvation to men by his "knowledge." For as the Angels were mismanaging
the world, since each of them desired the sovereignty, he had come to
set matters right; and that he had descended, transforming himself and
being made like to the Powers and Principalities and Angels; so that he
appeared to men as a man, although he was not a man; and was thought to
have suffered in Jud&aelig;a, although he did not really suffer. The
Prophets moreover had spoken their prophecies under the inspiration of
the Angels who made the world; wherefore those who believed on him and
his Helen paid no further attention to them, and followed their own
pleasure as though free; for men were saved by his grace, and not by
righteous works. For righteous actions are not according to nature, but
from accident, in the manner that the Angels who made the world have
laid it down, by such precepts enslaving men. Wherefore also he gave
new promises that the world should be dissolved and that they who were
his should be freed from the rule of those who made the world.</p>
<p> 4. Wherefore their initiated priests live immorally. And everyone
of them practises magic arts to the best of his ability. They use
exorcisms and incantations. Love philtres also and spells and what are
called "familiars" and "dream-senders," and the rest of the curious
arts are assiduously cultivated by them. They have also an image of
Simon made in the likeness of Jupiter, and of Helen in that of Minerva;
and they worship the (statues); and they have a designation from their
most impiously minded founder, being called Simonians, from whom the
Gn&ocirc;sis, falsely so-called, derives its origins, as one can learn
from their own assertions.</p>

<p>In the <i>Pr&aelig;scriptions</i> the passage is very short, the
briefest notice
possible, under the heading, "Anonymi Catalogus Heresum." The notice in
the <i>De Anima</i> runs as follows:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>For Simon the Samaritan also, the purveyor of the Holy Spirit, in
the <i>Acts of the Apostles</i>, after he had been condemned by
himself, together with his money, to perdition, shed vain tears and
betook himself to assaulting the truth, as though for the gratification
of vengeance. Supported by the powers of his art, for the purpose of
his illusions through some power or other, he purchased with the same
money a Tyrian woman Helen from a place of public pleasure, a fit
commodity instead of the Holy Spirit. And he pretended that he was the
highest Father, and that she was his first suggestion whereby he had
suggested the making of the Angels and Archangels; that she sharing in
this design had sprung forth from the Father, and leaped down into the
lower regions; and that there, the design of the Father being
prevented, she had brought forth Angelic Powers ignorant of the Father,
the artificer of this world; by these she was detained, not according
to his intention, lest when she had gone they should be thought to be
the progeny of another. And therefore being made subject to every kind
of contumely, so that by her depreciation she might not choose to
depart, she had sunk to as low as the human form, as though she had had
to be restrained by chains of flesh, and then for many ages being
turned about through a succession of female conditions, she became also
that Helen who proved so fatal to Priam, and after to the eyes of
Stesichorus, for she had caused his blindness on account of the insult
of his poem, and afterwards had removed it because of her pleasure at
his praise. And thus transmigrating from body to body, in the extreme
of dishonour she had stood, ticketed for hire, a Helen viler [than her
predecessor]. She was, therefore, the "lost sheep," to whom the highest
Father, Simon, you know, had descended. And after she was recovered and
brought back, I know not whether on his shoulders or knees, he
afterwards had respect to the salvation of men, as it were by the
liberation of those who had to be freed from these Angelic Powers, for
the purpose of deceiving whom he transformed himself, and pretended
that he was a man to men only, playing the part of the Son in
Jud&aelig;a, and that of the Father in Samaria.</p>

<div class="blkquot">
<p>7. I shall, therefore, set forth the system of Simon of Gittha, a
village of Samaria, and shall show that it is from him that those who
followed<a name="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>
him got their inspiration, and that the speculations they venture upon
have been of a like nature, though their terminology is different.</p>
<p> This Simon was skilled in magic, and deluding many, partly by the
art of Thrasymedes, in the way we have explained above,<a
 name="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> and
partly corrupting them by means of daemons, he endeavoured to deify
himself&#8212;a sorcerer fellow and full of insanity, whom the apostles
confuted in the <i>Acts</i>. Far more prudent and modest was the aim
of Apsethus, the Libyan, who tried to get himself thought a god in
Libya. And as the story of Apsethus is not very dissimilar to the
ambition of the foolish Simon, it will not be unseemly to repeat it,
for it is quite in keeping with Simon's endeavour.</p>
<p> 8. Apsethus, the Libyan, wanted to become a god. But in spite of
the greatest exertions he failed to realize his longing, and so he
desired that at any rate people should <i>think</i> that he had become
one; and, indeed, for a considerable time he really did get people to
think that such was the case. For the foolish Libyans sacrificed to him
as to some divine power, thinking that they were placing their
confidence in a voice that came down from heaven.</p>
<p> Well, he collected a large number of parrots and put them all into
a cage. For there are a great many parrots in Libya and they mimic the
human voice very distinctly. So he kept the birds for some time and
taught them to say, "Apsethus is a god." And when, after a long time,
the birds were trained and could speak the sentence which he considered
would make him be thought to be a god, he opened the cage and let the
parrots go in every direction. And the voice of the birds as they flew
about went out into all Libya, and their words reached as far as the
Greek settlements. And thus the Libyans, astonished at the voice of the
birds, and having no idea of the trick which had been played them by
Apsethus, considered him to be a god.</p>
<p> But one of the Greeks, correctly surmising the contrivance of the
supposed god, not only confuted him by means of the self-same parrots,
but also caused the total destruction of this boastful and vulgar
fellow. For the Greek caught a number of the parrots and re-taught them
to say "Apsethus caged us and made us say, 'Apsethus is a god.'" And
when the Libyans heard the recantation of the parrots, they all
assembled together of one accord and burnt Apsethus alive.</p>
<p> 9. And in the same way we must regard Simon, the magician, more
readily comparing him with the Libyan fellow's thus becoming a god. And
if the comparison is a correct one, and the fate which the magician
suffered was somewhat similar to that of Apsethus, let us endeavour to <i>re-teach
the parrots of Simon</i>, that he was not Christ, who has stood, stands
and will stand, but a man, the child of a woman, begotten of seed, from
blood and carnal desire, like other men. And that this is the case, we
shall easily demonstrate as our narrative proceeds.</p>
<p> Now Simon in his paraphrasing of the Law of Moses speaks with
artful misunderstanding. For when Moses says "God is a fire burning and
destroying,"<a name="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
taking in an incorrect sense what Moses said, he declares that Fire is
the Universal Principle, not understanding what was said, viz., not
that "God is fire," but "a fire burning and destroying." And thus he
not only tears to pieces the Law of Moses, but also plunders from
Heracleitus the obscure.<a name="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>
And Simon states that the Universal Principle is Boundless Power, as
follows:</p>
<p> "<i>This is the writing of the revelation of Voice and Name from
Thought, the Great Power, the Boundless. Wherefore shall it be sealed,
hidden, concealed, laid in the Dwelling of which the Universal Root is
the foundation</i>."<a name="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>
<p> And he says that man here below, born of blood, is the Dwelling,
and that the Boundless Power dwells in him, which he says is the
Universal Root. And, according to Simon, the Boundless Power, Fire, is
not a simple thing, as the majority who say that the four elements are
simple have considered fire also to be simple, but that the Fire has a
twofold nature; and of this twofold nature he calls the one side the
concealed and the other the manifested, (stating) that the concealed
(parts) of the Fire are hidden in the manifested, and the manifested
produced by the concealed.</p>
<p> This is what Aristotle calls "in potentiality" and "in actuality,"
and Plato the "intelligible" and "sensible."</p>
<p> And the manifested side of the Fire has all things in itself which
a man can perceive of things visible, or which he unconsciously fails
to perceive. Whereas the concealed side is everything which one can
conceive as intelligible, even though it escape sensation, or which a
man fails to conceive.</p>
<p> And generally we may say, of all things that are, both sensible and
intelligible, which he designates concealed and manifested, the Fire,
which is above the heavens, is the treasure-house, as it were a great
Tree, like that seen by Nabuchodonosor in vision, from which all flesh
is nourished. And he considers the manifested side of the Fire to be
the trunk, branches, leaves, and the bark surrounding it on the
outside. All these parts of the great Tree, he says, are set on fire
from the all-devouring flame of the Fire and destroyed. But the fruit
of the Tree, if its imaging has been perfected and it takes the shape
of itself, is placed in the storehouse, and not cast into the Fire. For
the fruit, he says, is produced to be placed in the storehouse, but the
husk to be committed to the Fire; that is to say, the trunk, which is
generated not for its own sake but for that of the fruit.</p>
<p> 10. And this he says is what is written in the scripture: "For the
vineyard of the Lord Saba&ocirc;th is the house of Israel, and a man of
Judah a well-beloved shoot."<a name="FNanchor_14"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> And if a man of Judah is a
well-beloved shoot, it is shown, he says, that a tree is nothing else
than a man. But concerning its sundering and dispersion, he says, the
scripture has sufficiently spoken, and what has been said is sufficient
for the instruction of those whose imaging has been perfected, viz.:
"All flesh is grass, and every glory of the flesh as the flower of
grass. The grass is dried up and the flower thereof falleth, but the
speech of the Lord endureth for the eternity (aeon)."<a
 name="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> Now
the Speech of the Lord, he says, is the Speech engendered in the mouth
and the Word (Logos), for elsewhere there is no place of production.</p>
<p> 11. To be brief, therefore, the Fire, according to Simon, being of
such a nature&#8212;both all things that are visible and invisible, and in
like manner, those that sound within and those that sound aloud, those
which can be numbered and those which are numbered&#8212;in the <i>Great
Revelation</i> he calls it the Perfect Intellectual, as (being)
everything that can be thought of an infinite number of times, in an
infinite number of ways, both as to speech, thought and action, just as
Empedocles<a name="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
says:</p>
<p> "By earth earth we perceive; by water, water; by aether [divine],
aether; fire by destructive fire; by friendship, friendship; and strife
by bitter strife."</p>
<p> 12. For, he says, he considered that all the parts of the Fire,
both visible and invisible, possessed perception<a name="FNanchor_17"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> and a portion of intelligence.
The generable cosmos, therefore, was generated from the ingenerable
Fire. And it commenced to be generated, he says, in the following way.
The first six Roots of the Principle of generation which the generated (<i>sc.</i>,
cosmos) took, were from that Fire. And the Roots, he says, were
generated from the Fire in pairs,<a name="FNanchor_18"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> and he calls these Roots Mind
and Thought, Voice and Name, Reason and Reflection, and in these six
Roots there was the whole of the Boundless Power together, in
potentiality, but not in actuality. And this Boundless Power he says is
He who has stood, stands and will stand; who, if his imaging is
perfected while in the six Powers, will be, in essence, power,
greatness and completeness, one and the same with the ingenerable and
Boundless Power, and not one single whit inferior to that ingenerable,
unchangeable and Boundless Power. But if it remain in potentiality
only, and its imaging is not perfected, then it disappears and
perishes, he says, just as the potentiality of grammar or geometry in a
man's mind. For potentiality when it has obtained art becomes the light
of generated things, but if it does not do so an absence of art and
darkness ensues, exactly as if it had not existed at all; and on the
death of the man it perishes with him.</p>
<p> 13. Of these six Powers and the seventh which is beyond the six, he
calls the first pair Mind and Thought, heaven and earth; and the male
(heaven) looks down from above and takes thought for its co-partner,
while the earth from below receives from the heaven the intellectual
fruits that come down to it and are cognate with the earth. Wherefore,
he says, the Word ofttimes steadfastly contemplating the things which
have been generated from Mind and Thought, that is from heaven and
earth, says: "Hear, O heaven, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord hath
said: I have generated sons and raised them up, but they have set me
aside."<a name="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>
<p> And he who says this, he says, is the seventh Power, He who has
stood, stands and will stand, for He is the cause of those good things
which Moses praised and said they were very good. And (the second pair
is) Voice and Name, sun and moon. And (the third) Reason and
Reflection, air and water. And in all of these was blended and mingled
the Great Power, the Boundless, He who has stood, as I have said.</p>
<p> 14. And when Moses says: "(It is) in six days that God made the
heaven and the earth, and on the seventh he rested from all his works,"
Simon arranges it differently and thus makes himself into a god. When,
therefore, they (the Simonians) say, that there are three days before
the generation of the sun and moon, they mean esoterically Mind and
Thought&#8212;that is to say heaven and earth&#8212;and the seventh Power, the
Boundless. For these three Powers were generated before all the others.
And when they say "he hath generated me before all the Aeons," the
words, he says, are used concerning the seventh Power. Now this seventh
Power which was the first Power subsisting in the Boundless Power,
which was generated before all the Aeons, this, he says, was the
seventh Power, about which Moses says: "And the spirit of God moved
over the water," that is to say, he says, the spirit which hath all
things in itself, the Image of the Boundless Power, concerning which
Simon says: "<i>The Image from, the incorruptible Form, alone ordering
all things.</i>" For the Power which moves above the water, he says, is
generated from an imperishable Form, and alone orders all things.</p>
<p> Now the constitution of the world being with them after this or a
similar fashion, God, he says, fashioned man by taking soil from the
earth. And he made him not single but double, according to the image
and likeness. And the Image is the spirit moving above the water,
which, if its imaging is not perfected, perishes together with the
world, seeing that it remains only in potentiality and does not become
in actuality. And this is the meaning of the Scripture, he says: "Lest
we be condemned together with the world."<a name="FNanchor_20"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> But if its imaging should be
perfected and it should be generated from an "indivisible point," as it
is written in his <i>Revelation</i>, the small shall become great. And
this great shall continue for the boundless and changeless eternity (<i>aeon</i>),
in as much as it is no longer in the process of becoming.<a
 name="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>
<p> How and in what manner, then, he asks, does God fashion man? In the
Garden (Paradise), he thinks. We must consider the womb a Garden, he
says, and that this is the "cave," the Scripture tells us when it says:
"I am he who fashioned thee in thy mother's womb,"<a name="FNanchor_22"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> for he would have it written
in this way. In speaking of the Garden, he says, Moses allegorically
referred to the womb, if we are to believe the Word.</p>
<p> And, if God fashions man in his mother's womb, that is to say in
the Garden, as I have already said, the womb must be taken for the
Garden, and Eden for the region (surrounding the womb), and the "river
going forth from Eden to water the Garden,"<a name="FNanchor_23"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> for the navel. This navel, he
says, is divided into four channels, for on either side of the navel
two air-ducts are stretched to convey the breath, and two veins<a
 name="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> to
convey blood. But when, he says, the navel going forth from the region
of Eden is attached to the foetus in the epigastric regions, that which
is commonly called by everyone the navel<a name="FNanchor_25"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> ... and the two veins by which
the blood flows and is carried from the Edenic region through what are
called the gates of the liver, which nourish the foetus. And the
air-ducts, which we said were channels for breath, embracing the
bladder on either side in the region of the pelvis, are united at the
great duct which is called the dorsal aorta. And thus the breath
passing through the side doors towards the heart produces the movement
of the embryo. For as long as the babe is being fashioned in the
Garden, it neither takes nourishment through the mouth, nor breathes
through the nostrils. For seeing that it is surrounded by the waters
(of the womb), death would instantly supervene, if it took a breath;
for it would draw after it the waters and so perish. But the whole (of
the foetus) is wrapped up in an envelope, called the amnion, and is
nourished through the navel and receives the essence of the breath
through the dorsal duct, as I have said.</p>
<p> 15. The river, therefore, he says, which goes out of Eden, is
divided into four channels, four ducts, that is to say; into four
senses of the foetus: sight, (hearing),<a name="FNanchor_26"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> smelling, taste and touch. For
these are the only senses the child has while it is being formed in the
Garden.</p>
<p> This, he says, is the law which Moses laid down, and in accordance
with this very law each of his books was written, as the titles show.
The first book is <i>Genesis</i>, and the title of the book, he says,
is sufficient for a knowledge of the whole matter. For this <i>Genesis</i>,
he says, is sight, which is one division of the river. For the world is
perceived by sight.</p>
<p> The title of the second book is <i>Exodus</i>. For it was
necessary for that which is born to travel through the Red Sea, and
pass towards the Desert&#8212;by Red the blood is meant, he says&#8212;and taste
the bitter water. For the "bitter," he says, is the water beyond the
Red Sea, inasmuch as it is the path of knowledge of painful and bitter
things which we travel along in life. But when it is changed by Moses,
that is to say by the Word, that bitter (water) becomes sweet. And that
this is so, all may hear publicly by repeating after the poets:</p>
<p> "In root it was black, but like milk was the flower. Moly the Gods
call it. For mortals to dig it up is difficult; but Gods can do all
things."<a name="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>
<p> 16. Sufficient, he says, is what is said by the Gentiles for a
knowledge of the whole matter, for those who have ears for hearing. For
he who tasted this fruit, he says, was not only not changed into a
beast by Circe, but using the virtue of the fruit, reshaped those who
had been already changed into beasts, into their former proper shape,
and re-struck and recalled their type. For the true man and one beloved
by that sorceress is discovered by this milk-white divine fruit, he
says.</p>
<p> In like manner <i>Leviticus</i>, the third book, is smelling or
respiration. For the whole of that book treats of sacrifices and
offerings. And wherever there is a sacrifice, there arises the smell of
the scent from the sacrifice owing to the incense, concerning which
sweet smell the sense of smell is the test.</p>
<p> <i>Numbers</i>, the fourth book, signifies taste, wherein speech
(or the Word) energizes. And it is so called through uttering all
things in numerical order.</p>
<p> <i>Deuteronomy</i>, again, he says, is so entitled in reference to
the sense of touch of the child which is formed. For just as the touch
by contact synthesizes and confirms the sensations of the other senses,
proving objects to be either hard, warm, or adhesive, so also the fifth
book of the Law is the synthesis of the four books which precede it.</p>
<p> All ingenerables, therefore, he says, are in us in potentiality but
not in actuality, like the science of grammar or geometry. And if they
meet with befitting utterance<a name="FNanchor_28"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> and instruction, and the
"bitter" is turned into the "sweet"&#8212;that is to say, spears into reaping
hooks and swords into ploughshares<a name="FNanchor_29"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a>&#8212;the Fire will not have born to
it husks and stocks, but perfect fruit, perfected in its imaging, as I
said above, equal and similar to the ingenerable and Boundless Power.
"For now," says he, "the axe is nigh to the roots of the tree: every
tree," he says, "that bringeth not forth good fruit, is cut down and
cast into the fire."<a name="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>
<p> 17. And so, according to Simon, that blessed and imperishable
(principle) concealed in everything, is in potentiality, but not in
actuality, which indeed is He who has stood, stands and will stand; who
has stood above in the ingenerable Power, who stands below in the
stream of the waters, generated in an image, who shall stand above, by
the side of the blessed and Boundless Power, if the imaging be
perfected. For three, he says, are they that stand, and without there
being three standing Aeons, there would be no setting in order<a
 name="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> of
the generable which, according to them, moves on the water, and which
is fashioned according to the similitude into a perfect celestial,
becoming in no whit inferior to the ingenerable Power, and this is the
meaning of their saying: "<i>Thou and I, the one thing; before me,
thou; that after thee, I.</i>"</p>
<p> This, he says, is the one Power, separated into the above and
below, generating itself, increasing itself, seeking itself, finding
itself, its own mother, its own father, its sister, its spouse; the
daughter, son, mother, and father of itself; One, the Universal Root.</p>
<p> And that, as he says, the beginning of the generation of things
which are generated is from Fire, he understands somewhat in this
fashion. Of all things of which there is generation, the beginning of
the desire for their generation is from Fire. For, indeed, the desire
of mutable generation is called "being on fire." And though Fire is
one, yet has it two modes of mutation. For in the man, he says, the
blood, being hot and yellow&#8212;like fire when it takes form&#8212;is turned into
seed, whereas in the woman the same blood (is changed) into milk. And
this change in the male becomes the faculty of generating, while that
in the female (becomes) nourishment for the child. This, he says, is
"the flaming sword that is turned about to keep the way of the tree of
life."<a name="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a>
For the blood is turned into seed and milk; and this Power becomes
mother and father, father of those that are born, and mother of those
that are nourished, standing in want of nothing, sufficient unto
itself. And the tree of life, he says, is guarded by the fiery sword
which is turned about, (which tree), as we have said, (is) the seventh
Power which proceeds from itself, contains all (in itself), and is
stored in the six Powers. For were the flaming sword not turned about,
that fair tree would be destroyed and perish; but if it is turned into
seed and milk, that which is stored in them in potentiality, having
obtained a fitting utterance,<a name="FNanchor_33"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> and an appointed place in
which the utterance may be developed, starting as it were from the
smallest spark, it will increase to all perfection, and expand, and be
an infinite power, unchangeable, equal and similar to the unchangeable
Aeon, which is no more generated for the boundless eternity.</p>
<p> 18. Conformably, therefore, to this reasoning, for the foolish,
Simon was a god, like that Libyan Apsethus; (a god) subject to
generation and suffering, so long as he remained in potentiality, but
freed from the bonds of suffering and birth, as soon as his imaging
forth was accomplished, and attaining perfection he passed forth from
the first two Powers, to wit heaven and earth. For Simon speaks
distinctly concerning this in his <i>Revelation</i> as follows:</p>
<p> "<i>To you, therefore, I say what I say, and write what I write.
And the writing is this.</i></p>
<p> "<i>Of the universal Aeons there are two shoots, without beginning
or end, springing from one Root, which is the Power invisible,
inapprehensible Silence. Of these shoots one is manifested from above,
which is the Great Power, the Universal Mind ordering all things, male,
and the other, (is manifested) from below, the Great Thought, female,
producing all things</i>.</p>
<p> "<i>Hence pairing with each other</i>,<a name="FNanchor_34"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> <i>they unite and manifest
the Middle Distance, incomprehensible Air, without beginning or end. In
this is the Father who sustains all things, and nourishes those things
which have a beginning and end.</i></p>
<p> "<i>This is He who has stood, stands and will stand, a male-female
power like the pre&euml;xisting Boundless Power, which has neither
beginning nor end, existing in oneness. For it is from this that the
Thought in the oneness proceeded and became two.</i></p>
<p> "<i>So he</i><a name="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a>
<i>was one; for having her</i><a name="FNanchor_36"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> <i>in himself, he was alone,
not however first, although pre&euml;xisting, but being manifested from
himself to himself, he became second. Nor was he called Father before
(Thought) called him Father.</i></p>
<p> "<i>As, therefore, producing himself by himself, he manifested to
himself his own Thought, so also the Thought that was manifested did
not make the Father, but contemplating him hid him&#8212;that is to say the
Power&#8212;in herself, and is male-female, Power and Thought.</i></p>
<p> "<i>Hence they pair with each other being one, for there is no
difference between Power and Thought. From the things above is
discovered Power, and from those below Thought.</i></p>
<p> "<i>In the same manner also that which was manifested from them</i><a
 name="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> <i>although
being one is yet found as two, the male-female having the female in
itself. Thus Mind is in Thought&#8212;things inseparable from one
another&#8212;which although being one are yet found as two.</i>"</p>
<p> 19. So then Simon by such inventions got what interpretation he
pleased, not only out of the writings of Moses, but also out of those
of the (pagan) poets, by falsifying them. For he gives an allegorical
interpretation of the wooden horse, and Helen with the torch, and a
number of other things, which he metamorphoses and weaves into fictions
concerning himself and his Thought.</p>
<p> And he said that the latter was the "lost sheep," who again and
again abiding in women throws the Powers in the world into confusion,
on account of her unsurpassable beauty; on account of which the Trojan
War came to pass through her. For this Thought took up its abode in the
Helen that was born just at that time, and thus when all the Powers
laid claim to her, there arose faction and war among those nations to
whom she was manifested.</p>
<p> It was thus, forsooth, that Stesichorus was deprived of sight when
he abused her in his verses; and afterwards when he repented and wrote
the recantation in which he sung her praises he recovered his sight.</p>
<p> And subsequently, when her body was changed by the Angels and lower
Powers&#8212;which also, he says, made the world&#8212;she lived in a brothel in
Tyre, a city of Phoenicia, where he found her on his arrival. For he
professes that he had come there for the purpose of finding her for the
first time, that he might deliver her from bondage. And after he had
purchased her freedom he took her about with him, pretending that she
was the "lost sheep," and that he himself was the Power which is over
all. Whereas the impostor having fallen in love with this strumpet,
called Helen, purchased and kept her, and being ashamed to have it
known by his disciples, invented this story.</p>
<p> And those who copy the vagabond magician Simon do like acts, and
pretend that intercourse should be promiscuous, saying: "All soil is
soil, and it matters not where a man sows, so long as he does sow."
Nay, they pride themselves on promiscuous intercourse, saying that this
is the "perfect love," citing the text, "the holy shall be sanctified
by the ... of the holy."<a name="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a>
And they profess that they are not in the power of that which is
usually considered evil, for they are redeemed. For by purchasing the
freedom of Helen, he (Simon) thus offered salvation to men by knowledge
peculiar to himself.<a name="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>
<p> For he said that, as the Angels were misgoverning the world owing
to their love of power, he had come to set things right, being
metamorphosed and made like unto the Dominions, Principalities and
Angels, so that he was manifested as a man although he was not really a
man, and that he seemed to suffer<a name="FNanchor_40"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> in Jud&aelig;a, although he
did not really undergo it, but that he was manifested to the Jews as
the Son, in Samaria as the Father, and among the other nations as the
Holy Ghost, and that he permitted himself to be called by whatever name
men pleased to call him. And that it was by the Angels, who made the
world, that the Prophets were inspired to utter their prophecies.
Wherefore they who believe on Simon and Helen pay no attention to the
latter even to this day, but do everything they like, as being free,
for they contend that they are saved through his (Simon's) grace.</p>
<p> For (they assert that) there is no cause for punishment if a man
does ill, for evil is not in nature but in institution. For, he says,
the Angels who made the world, instituted what they wished, thinking by
such words to enslave all who listened to them. Whereas the dissolution
of the world, they (the Simonians) say, is for the ransoming of their
own people.</p>
<p> 20. And (Simon's) disciples perform magical ceremonies and (use)
incantations, and philtres and spells, and they also send what are
called "dream-sending" daemons for disturbing whom they will. They also
train what are called "familiars,"<a name="FNanchor_41"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> and have a statue of Simon in
the form of Zeus, and one of Helen in the form of Athena, which they
worship, calling the former Lord and the latter Lady. And if any among
them on seeing the images, calls them by the name of Simon or Helen, he
is cast out as one ignorant of the mysteries.</p>
<p> While this Simon was leading many astray by his magic rites in
Samaria, he was confuted by the apostles. And being cursed, as it is
written in the <i>Acts</i>, in dissatisfaction took to these schemes.
And at last he travelled to Rome and again fell in with the apostles,
and Peter had many encounters with him for he continued leading numbers
astray by his magic. And towards the end of his career going ... he
settled under a plane tree and continued his teachings. And finally
running the risk of exposure through the length of his stay, he said,
that if he were buried alive, he would rise again on the third day. And
he did actually order a grave to be dug by his disciples and told them
to bury him. So they carried out his orders, but he has stopped away<a
 name="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a>
until the present day, for he was not the Christ.</p>
</div>
<p>vi. Origenes (<i>Contra Celsum</i>, i. 57; v. 62; vi. ii). Text

<div class="blkquot">
<p>i. 57. And Simon also, the Samaritan magician, endeavoured to steal
away certain by his magic. And at that time he succeeded in deceiving
them, but in our own day I do not think it possible to find thirty
Simonians altogether in the inhabited world. And probably I have said
more than they really are. There are a very few of them round
Palestine; but in the rest of the world his name is nowhere to be found
in the sense of the doctrine he wished to spread broadcast concerning
himself. And alongside of the reports about him, we have the account
from the <i>Acts</i>. And they who say these things about him are
Christians and their clear witness is that Simon was nothing divine.</p>
<p> v. 62. Then pouring out a quantity of our names, he (Celsus) says
he knows certain Simonians who are called Heleniani, because they
worship Helen or a teacher Helenus. But Celsus is ignorant that the
Simonians in no way confess that Jesus is the Son of God, but they say
that Simon is the Power of God, telling some marvellous stories about
the fellow, who thought that if he laid claim to like powers as those
which he thought Jesus laid claim to, he also would be as powerful
among men as Jesus is with many.</p>
<p> vi. ii. For the former (Simon) pretended he was the Power of God,
which is called Great, and the latter (Dositheus) that he too was the
Son of God. For nowhere in the world do the Simonians any longer exist.
Moreover by getting many under his influence Simon took away from his
disciples the danger of death, which Christians were taught was taken
away, teaching them that there was no difference between it and
idolatry. And yet in the beginning the Simonians were not plotted
against. For the evil daemon who plots against the teaching of Jesus,
knew that no counsel of his own would be undone by the disciples of
Simon.</p>

<div class="blkquot">
<p>Now after the passion of Christ, our Lord, and his ascension into
heaven, there arose a certain Simon, the magician, a Samaritan by
birth, from a village called Gittha, who having the leisure necessary
for the arts of magic deceived many, saying that he was some Power of
God, above all powers. Whom the Samaritans worship as the Father, and
wickedly extol as the founder of their heresy, and strive to exalt him
with many praises. Who having been baptized by the blessed apostles,
went back from their faith, and disseminated a wicked and pernicious
heresy, saying that he was transformed supposedly, that is to say like
a shadow, and thus he had suffered, although, he says, he did not
suffer.</p>
<p> And he also dared to say that the world had been made by Angels,
and the Angels again had been made by certain endowed with perception
from heaven, and that they (the Angels) had deceived the human race.</p>
<p> He asserted, moreover, that there was a certain other Thought, who
descended into the world for the salvation of men; he says she was that
Helen whose story is celebrated in the Trojan War by the vain-glorious
poets. And the Powers, he says, led on by desire of this Helen, stirred
up sedition. "For she," he says, "arousing desire in those Powers, and
appearing in the form of a woman, could not re&auml;scend into heaven,
because the Powers which were in heaven did not permit her to
reascend." Moreover, she looked for another Power, that is to say, the
presence of Simon himself, which would come and free her.</p>
<p> The wooden horse also, which the vain-glorious poets say was in the
Trojan War, he asserted was allegorical, namely, that that mechanical
invention typified the ignorance of all the impious nations, although
it is well known that that Helen, who was with the magician, was a
prostitute from Tyre, and that this same Simon, the magician, had
followed her, and together with her had practised various magic arts
and committed divers crimes.</p>
<p> But after he had fled from the blessed Peter from the city of
Jerusalem, and came to Rome, and contended there with the blessed
apostle before the Emperor Nero, he was routed on every point by the
speech of the blessed apostle, and being smitten by an angel came by a
righteous end in order that the glaring falsity of his magic might be
made known unto all men.</p>

<div class="blkquot">
<p>1. From the time of Christ to our own day the first heresy was that
of Simon the magician, and though it was not correctly and distinctly
one of the Christian name, yet it worked great havoc by the corruption
it produced among Christians. This Simon was a sorcerer, and the base
of his operations was at Gittha, a city in Samaria, which still exists
as a village. And he deluded the Samaritan people with magical
phenomena, deluding and enticing them with a bait by saying that he was
the Great Power of God and had come down from above. And he told the
Samaritans that he was the Father, and the Jews that he was the Son,
and that in undergoing the passion he had not really done so, but that
it was only in appearance. And he ingratiated himself with the
apostles, was baptized by Philip with many others, and received the
same rite as the rest. And all except himself awaited the arrival of
the great apostles and by the laying on of their hands received the
Holy Spirit, for Philip, being a deacon, had not the power of laying on
of hands to grant thereby the gift of the Holy Spirit. But Simon, with
wicked heart and erroneous calculations, persisted in his base and
mercenary covetousness, without abandoning in any way his miserable
pursuits, and offered money to Peter, the apostle, for the power of
bestowing the Holy Spirit by the laying on of hands, calculating that
he would give little, and that for the little (he gave), by bestowing
the Spirit on many, he would amass a large sum of money and make a
profit.</p>
<p> 2. So with his mind in a vile state through the devilish illusions
produced by his magic, and weaving all kinds of images, and being ever
ready of his own villany to show his barbaric and demoniacal tricks by
means of his charms, he came forward publicly and under the cloak of
the name of Christ; and pretending that he was mixing hellebore<a
 name="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> with
honey, he added a poison for those whom he hunted into his mischievous
illusion, under the cloak of the name of Christ, and compassed the
death of those who believed. And being lewd in nature and goaded on
through shame of his promises, the vagabond fabricated a corrupt
allegory for those whom he had deceived. For picking up a roving woman,
called Helen, who originated from the city of the Tyrians, he took her
about with him, without letting people know that he was on terms of
undue intimacy with her; and when he was involved in bursting disgrace
because of his mistress, he started a fabulous kind of psychopompy<a
 name="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> for
his disciples, and saying, forsooth, that he was the Great Power of
God, he ventured to call his prostitute companion the Holy Spirit, and
he says that it was on her account he descended. "And in each heaven I
changed my form," he says, "in order that I might not be perceived by
my Angelic Powers, and descend to my Thought, which is she who is
called Prun&icirc;cus<a name="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a>
and Holy Spirit, through whom I brought into being the Angels, and the
Angels brought into being the world and men." (He claimed) that this
was the Helen of old, on whose account the Trojans and Greeks went to
war. And he related a myth with regard to these matters, that this
Power descending from above changed its form, and that it was about
this that the poets spake allegorically. And through this Power from
above&#8212;which they call Prun&icirc;cus, and which is called by other
sects Barbero or Barbelo&#8212;displaying her beauty, she drove them to
frenzy, and on this account was she sent for the despoiling of the
Rulers who brought the world into being; and the Angels themselves went
to war on her account; and while she experienced nothing, they set to
work to mutually slaughter each other on account of the desire which
she infused into them for herself. And constraining her so that she
could not re&auml;scend, each had intercourse with her in every body of
womanly and female constitution&#8212;she re&iuml;ncarnating from female
bodies into different bodies, both of the human kingdom, and of beasts
and other things&#8212;in order that by means of their slaying and being
slain, they might bring about a diminution of themselves through the
shedding of blood, and that then she by collecting again the Power
would be enabled to re&auml;scend into heaven.</p>
<p> 3. And she it was at that time who was possessed by the Greeks and
Trojans; and that both in the night of time before the world existed,
and after its existence, by the invisible Powers she had wrought things
of a like nature. "And she it is who is now with me, and on her account
have I descended. And she was looking for my coming. For she is the
Thought,<a name="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a>
called Helen in Homer." And it was on this account that Homer was
compelled to portray her as standing on a tower, and by means of a
torch revealing to the Greeks the plot of the Phrygians. And by the
torch, he delineated, as I said, the manifestation of the light from
above. On which account also the wooden horse in Homer was devised,
which the Greeks think was made for a distinct purpose, whereas the
sorcerer maintained that this is the ignorance of the Gentiles, and
that like as the Phrygians when they dragged it along in ignorance drew
on their own destruction, so also the Gentiles, that is to say people
who are "without my wisdom," through ignorance, draw ruin on
themselves. Moreover the impostor said that Athena again was identical
with what they called Thought, making use forsooth of the words of the
holy apostle Paul&#8212;changing the truth into his own lie&#8212;to wit: "Put on
the breastplate of faith and the helmet of salvation, and the greaves
and sword and buckler";<a name="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a>
and that all this was in the mimes of Philistion,<a name="FNanchor_48"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> the rogue!&#8212;words uttered by
the apostle with firm reasoning and faith of holy conversation, and the
power of the divine and heavenly word&#8212;turning them further into a joke
and nothing more. For what does he say? That he (Philistion) arranged
all these things in a mysterious manner into types of Athena. Wherefore
again, in making known the woman with him whom he had taken from Tyre
and who had the same name as Helen of old, he spoke as I have told you
above, calling her by all those names, Thought, and Athena, and Helen
and the rest. "And on her account," he says, "I descended. And this is
the 'lost sheep' written of in the Gospel." Moreover, he left to his
followers an image, his own presumably, and they worship it under the
form of Zeus; and he left another in like manner of Helen in the guise
of Athena, and his dupes worship them.</p>
<p> 4. And he enjoined mysteries of obscenity and&#8212;to set it forth more
seriously&#8212;of the sheddings of bodies, <i>emissionum virorom, feminarum
menstruorum</i>, and that they should be gathered up for mysteries in a
most filthy collection; that these were the mysteries of life, and of
the most perfect Gn&ocirc;sis&#8212;a practice which anyone who has
understanding from God would most naturally consider to be most filthy
conduct and death rather than life. And he supposes names for the
Dominions and Principalities, and says there are different heavens, and
sets forth Powers for each firmament and heaven, and tricks them out
with barbarous names, and says that no man can be saved in any other
fashion than by learning this mystagogy, and how to offer such
sacrifices to the Universal Father through these Dominions and
Principalities. And he says that this world (aeon) was constructed
defectively by Dominions and Principalities of evil. And he considers
that corruption and destruction are of the flesh alone, but that there
is a purification of souls and that, only if they are established in
initiation by means of his misleading Gn&ocirc;sis. This is the
beginning of the so-called Gnostics. And he pretended that the Law was
not of God, but of the left-hand Power, and that the Prophets were not
from the Good God but from this or the other Power. And he lays it down
for each of them as he pleases: the Law was of one, David of another,
Isaiah of another, Ezekiel again of another, and ascribes each of the
Prophets to some one Dominion. And all of them were from the left-hand
Power and outside the Perfection,<a name="FNanchor_49"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> and every one that believed in
the <i>Old Testament</i> was subject to death.</p>
<p> 5. But this doctrine is overturned by the truth itself. For if he
were the Great Power of God, and the harlot with him the Holy Spirit,
as he himself says, let him say what is the name of the Power or in
what word<a name="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a>
he discovered the epithet for the woman and nothing for himself at all.
And how and at what time is he found at Rome successively paying back
his debt, when in the midst of the city of the Romans the miserable
fellow fell down and died? And in what scripture did Peter prove to him
that he had neither lot nor share in the heritage of the fear of God?
And could the world not have its existence in the Good God, when all
the good were chosen by him? And how could it be a left-hand Power
which spake in the Law and Prophets, when it has preached the coming of
the Christ, the Good God, and forbids mean things? And how could there
not be one divine nature and the same spirit of the <i>New</i> and <i>Old
Testament</i>, when the Lord said: "I am not come to destroy the Law,
but to fulfil it"?<a name="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a>
And that He might show that the Law was declared through Him and was
given through Moses, and that the grace of the Gospel has been preached
through himself and his carnal presence, He said to the Jews: "If ye
believe Moses, ye should also believe me; for he wrote about me."<a
 name="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a>
There are many other arguments also to oppose to the contention of the
sorcerer. For how will obscene things give life, if it were not a
conception of daemons? When the Lord himself answers in the Gospel to
those who say unto him: "If such is the case of the man and the woman,
it is not good to marry." But He said unto them: "All do not hold this;
for there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the
kingdom of the heavens."<a name="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a>
And He showed that natural abstinence from union is the gift of the
kingdom of the heavens; and again in another place He says with respect
to righteous marriage&#8212;which Simon of his own accord basely corrupting
treats according to his own desires&#8212;"Whom God has joined together let
no man put asunder."<a name="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>
<p> 6. And how unaware is again the vagabond that he confutes himself
by his own babbling, not knowing what he gives out? For after saying
that the Angels were produced by him through his Thought, he goes on to
say that he changed his form in every heaven, to escape their notice in
his descent. Consequently he avoided them through fear. And how did the
babbler fear the Angels whom he had himself made? And how will not the
dissemination of his error be found by the intelligent to be instantly
refuted by everyone, when the scripture says: "In the beginning<a
 name="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> God
made the heaven and the earth"?<a name="FNanchor_56"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> And in unison with this word,
the Lord in the Gospel says, as though to his own Father: "O Father,
Lord of heaven and earth."<a name="FNanchor_57"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> If, therefore, the maker of
heaven and earth is naturally God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
all that the slanderer Simon says is vain; to wit, the defective
production of the world by the Angels, and all the rest he has babbled
about in addition to his world of Daemons, and he has deceived those
who have been led away by him.</p>

<p>Now Simon, the Samaritan magician, was the first minister of his
(the Daemon's)<a name="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a>
evil practices who arose. Who, making his base of operations from
Gittha, which is a village of Samaria, and having rushed to the height
of sorcery, at first persuaded many, by the wonder-working he wrought,
to attend his school, and call him some divine Power. But afterwards
seeing the apostles accomplishing wonder-workings that were really true
and divine, and bestowing on those who came to them the grace of the
Spirit, thinking himself also worthy to receive equal power from them,
when great Peter detected his villainous intention, and bade him heal
the incurable wounds of his mind with the drugs of repentance, he
immediately returned to his former evil-doing, and leaving Samaria,
since it had received the seeds of salvation, ran off to those who had
not yet been tilled by the apostles, in order that, having deceived
with his magic arts those who were easy to capture, and having enslaved
them in the bonds of their own legendary lore,<a name="FNanchor_59"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> he might make the teachings of
the apostles difficult to be believed.</p>
<p> But the divine grace armed great Peter against the fellow's
madness. For following after him, he dispelled his abominable teaching
like mist and darkness, and showed forth the rays of the light of
truth. But for all that the thrice wretched fellow, in spite of his
public exposure, did not cease from his working against the truth,
until he came to Rome, in the reign of Claudius C&aelig;sar. And he so
astonished the Romans with his sorceries that he was honoured with a
brazen pillar. But on the arrival of the divine Peter, he stripped him
naked of his wings of deception, and finally, having challenged him to
a contest in wonder-working, and having shown the difference between
the divine grace and sorcery, in the presence of the assembled Romans,
caused him to fall headlong from a great height by his prayers and
captured the eye-witnesses of the wonder for salvation.</p>
<p> This (Simon) gave birth to a legend somewhat as follows. He started
with supposing some Boundless Power; and he called this the Universal
Root.<a name="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a>
And he said that this was Fire, which had a twofold energy, the
manifested and the concealed. The world moreover was generable, and had
been generated from the manifested energy of the Fire. And first from
it (the manifested energy) were emanated three pairs, which he also
called Roots. And the first (pair) he called Mind and Thought, and the
second, Voice and Intelligence, and the third, Reason and Reflection.
Whereas he called himself the Boundless Power, and (said) that he had
appeared to the Jews as the Son, and to the Samaritans he had descended
as the Father, and among the rest of the nations he had gone up and
down as the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p> And having made a certain harlot, who was called Helen, live with
him, he pretended that she was his first Thought, and called her the
Universal Mother, (saying) that through her he had made both the Angels
and Archangels; and that the world was fabricated by the Angels. Then
the Angels in envy cast her down among them, for they did not wish, he
says, to be called fabrications. For which cause, forsooth, they
induced her into many female bodies and into that of the famous Helen,
through whom the Trojan War arose.</p>
<p> It was on her account also, he said, that he himself had descended,
to free her from the chains they had laid upon her, and to offer to men
salvation through a system of knowledge peculiar to himself.</p>
<p> And that in his descent he had undergone transformation, so as not
to be known to the Angels that manage the establishment of the world.
And that he had appeared in Jud&aelig;a as a man, although he was not a
man, and that he had suffered, though not at all suffering, and that
the Prophets were the ministers of the Angels. And he admonished those
that believed on him not to pay attention to them, and not to tremble
at the threats of the Law, but, as being free, to do whatever they
would. For it was not by good actions, but by grace they would gain
salvation.</p>
<p> For which cause, indeed, those of his association ventured on every
kind of licentiousness, and practised every kind of magic, fabricating
love philtres and spells, and all the other arts of sorcery, as though
in pursuit of divine mysteries. And having prepared his (Simon's)
statue in the form of Zeus, and Helen's in the likeness of Athena, they
burn incense and pour out libations before them, and worship them as
gods, calling themselves Simonians.</p>

</div>
<p>Summary.<a name="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a>
Clement, the hero of the legendary narrative, arrives at
C&aelig;sarea Stratonis in Jud&aelig;a, on the eve of a great
controversy between
Simon and the apostle Peter, and attaches himself to the latter as his
disciple (H. II. xv; R.I. lxxvii). The history of Simon is told to
Clement, in the presence of Peter, by Aquila and Nicetas&#8212;the adopted
sons of a convert&#8212;who had associated with Simon.</p>
<p>Simon was the son of Antonius and Rachael, a Samaritan of Gittha, a
village six schoeni<a name="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a>
from the city of C&aelig;sarea (H.I. xxii), called a
village of the Gettones (R. II. vii). It was at Alexandria that Simon
perfected his studies in magic, being an adherent of John, a
Hemero-baptist,<a name="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a>
through whom he came to deal with religious
doctrines.</p>
<p>John was the forerunner of Jesus, according to the method of
combination
or coupling.<a name="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a>
Whereas Jesus had twelve disciples, as the Sun, John,
the Moon, had thirty, the number of days in a lunation, or more
correctly twenty-nine and a half, one of his disciples being a woman
called Helen, and a woman being reckoned as half a man in the perfect
number of the Triacontad, or Pler&ocirc;ma of the Aeons (H.I. xxiii; R.
II.
viii). In the <i>Recognitions</i> the name of Helen is given as Luna
in the
Latin translation of Rufinus.<a name="FNanchor_67"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>
<p>Of all John's disciples, Simon was the favourite, but on the death
of
his master, he was absent in Alexandria, and so Dositheus,<a
 name="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> a
co-disciple, was chosen head of the school.</p>
<p>Simon, on his return, acquiesced in the choice, but his superior
knowledge could not long remain under a bushel. One day Dositheus,
becoming enraged, struck at Simon with his staff; but the staff passed
through Simon's body like smoke, and Dositheus, struck with amazement,
yielded the leadership to Simon and became his disciple, and shortly
afterwards died (H.I. xxiv; R. II. xiii).</p>
<p>Aquila and Nicetas then go on to tell how Simon had confessed to
them
privately his love for Luna (R. II. viii), and narrate the magic
achievements possessed by Simon, of which they have had proof with
their
own eyes. Simon can dig through mountains, pass through rocks as if
they
were merely clay, cast himself from a lofty mountain and be borne
gently
to earth, can break his chains when in prison, and cause the doors to
open of their own accord, animate statues and make the eye-witness
think
them men, make trees grow suddenly, pass through fire unhurt, change
his
face or become double-faced, or turn into a sheep or goat or serpent,
make a beard grow upon a boy's chin, fly in the air, become gold, make
and unmake kings, have divine worship and honours paid him, order a
sickle to go and reap of itself and it reaps ten times as much as an
ordinary sickle (R. II. xi).</p>
<p>To this list of wonders the <i>Homilies</i> add making stones into
loaves,
melting iron, the production of images of all kinds at a banquet; in
his
own house dishes are brought of themselves to him (H.I. xxxii). He
makes
spectres appear in the market place; when he walks out statues move,
and
shadows go before him which he says are souls of the dead (H. IV. iv).</p>
<p>On one occasion Aquila says he was present when Luna was seen
looking
out of all the windows of a tower on all sides at once (R. II. xi).</p>
<p>The most peculiar incident, however, is the use Simon is said to
have
made of the soul of a dead boy, by which he did many of his wonders.
The
incident is found in both accounts, but more fully in the <i>Homilies</i>
(I.
xxv-xxx) than in the <i>Recognitions</i> (II. xiii-xv), for which
reason the
text of the former is followed.</p>
<p>Simon did not stop at murder, as he confessed to Nicetas and Aquila
"as
a friend to friends." In fact he separated the soul of a boy from his
body to act as a confederate in his phenomena. And this is the magical
<i>modus operandi</i>. "He delineates the boy on a statue which he
keeps
consecrated in the inner part of the house where he sleeps, and he says
that after he has fashioned him out of the air by certain divine
transmutations, and has sketched his form, he returns him again to the
air."</p>
<p>Simon explains the theory of this practice as follows:</p>
<p>"First of all the spirit of the man having been turned into the
nature
of heat draws in and absorbs, like a cupping-glass, the surrounding
air;
next he turns the air which comes within the envelope of spirit into
water. And the air in it not being able to escape owing to the
confining
force of the spirit, he changed it into the nature of blood, and the
blood solidifying made flesh; and so when the flesh is solidified he
exhibited a man made of air and not of earth. And thus having persuaded
himself of his ability to make a new man of air, he reversed the
transmutations, he said, and returned him to the air."</p>
<p>When the converts thought that this was the soul of the person,
Simon
laughed and said, that in the phenomena it was not the soul, "but some
daemon<a name="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a>
who pretended to be the soul that took possession of people."</p>
<p>The coming controversy with Simon is then explained by Peter to
Clement
to rest on certain passages of scripture. Peter admits that there are
falsehoods in the scriptures, but says that it would never do to
explain
this to the people. These falsehoods have been permitted for certain
righteous reasons (H. III. v).</p>
<p>"For the scriptures declare all manner of things that no one of
those
who enquire unthankfully may discover the truth, but (simply) what he
wishes to find" (H. III. x).</p>
<p>In the lengthy explanation which follows, however, on the passages
Simon
is going to bring forward, such as the mention of a plurality of gods,
and God's hardening men's hearts, Peter states that in reality all the
passages which speak against God are spurious additions, but this is to
be guarded as an esoteric secret.</p>
<p>Nevertheless in the public controversy which follows, this secret is
made public property, in order to meet Simon's declaration: "I say that
there are many gods, but one God of all these gods, incomprehensible
and
unknown to all" (R. II. xxxviii); and again: "My belief is that there
is
a Power of immeasurable and ineffable Light, whose greatness is held to
be incomprehensible, a power which the maker of the world even does not
know, nor does Moses the lawgiver, nor your master Jesus" (R. II. xlix).</p>
<p>A point of interest to be noticed is that Peter challenges Simon to
substantiate his statements by quotations either from the scriptures of
the Jews, or from some they had not heard of, or from those of the
Greeks, or from <i>his own</i> scriptures (R. II. xxxviii).</p>
<p>Simon argues that finding the God of the Law imperfect, he concludes
this is not the supreme God. After a wordy harangue of Peter, Simon is
said to have been worsted by Peter's threatening to go to Simon's
bed-chamber and question the soul of the murdered boy. Simon flies to
Tyre (H.) or Tripolis (R.), and Peter determines to pursue him among
the
Gentiles.</p>
<p>The two accounts here become exceedingly contradictory and confused.
According to the <i>Homilies</i>, Simon flees from Tyre to Tripolis,
and
thence further to Syria. The main dispute takes place at Laodic&aelig;a
on the
unity of God (XVI. i). Simon appeals to the <i>Old Testament</i> to
show that
there are many gods (XVI. iv); shows that the scriptures contradict
themselves (XVI. ix); accuses Peter of using magic and teaching
doctrines different to those taught by Christ (XVII. ii-iv); asserts
that Jesus is not consistent with himself (XVII. v); that the maker of
the world is not the highest God (XVIII. i); and declares the Ineffable
Deity (XVIII. iv).<a name="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a>
Peter of course refutes him (XVIII. xii-xiv), and
Simon retires.</p>
<p>The last incident of interest takes place at Antioch. Simon stirs up
the
people against Peter by representing him as an impostor. Friends of
Peter set the authorities on Simon's track, and he has to flee. At
Laodic&aelig;a he meets Faustinianus (R.), or Faustus (H.), the father
of
Clement, who rebukes him (H. XIX. xxiv); and so he changes the face of
Faustinianus into an exact likeness of his own that he may be taken in
his place (H. XX. xii; R.X. liii). Peter sends the transformed
Faustinianus to Antioch, who, in the guise of Simon, makes a confession
of imposture and testifies to the divine mission of Peter. Peter
accordingly enters Antioch in triumph.</p>
<p>The story of Simon in the <i>Apostolic Constitutions</i> is short
and taken
from the <i>Acts</i>, and to some extent from the Clementines,
finishing up,
however, with the mythical death of Simon at Rome, owing to the prayers
of Peter. Simon is here said to be conducted by daemons and to have
flown (<span title="hiptato" lang="el">&#953;&#960;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#959;</span>) upwards. The
details of this magical feat are
given variously elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_71"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>
<p>The only point of real interest is a vague reference to Simonian
literature (VI. xvi), in a passage which runs as follows:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>For we know that the followers of Simon and Cleobius having composed
poisonous books in the name of Christ and his disciples, carry them
about for the deception of you who have loved Christ and us his
servants.<a name="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p>So end the most important of the legends. To these, however, must be
added others of a like nature of which the scene of action is laid at
Rome in the time of Nero.<a name="FNanchor_73"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> I have not thought it worth
while to refer
to the original texts for these utterly apocryphal and unauthenticated
stories, but simply append a very short digest from the excellent
summary of Dr. Salmon, the Regius Professor of Divinity in Dublin
University, as given in Smith and Wace's <i>Dictionary of Christian
Biography</i>.<a name="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>
<p>The Greek <i>Acts of Peter and Paul</i> give details of the
conflict and
represent both apostles as having taken part in it. Simon and Peter are
each required to raise a dead body to life. Simon, by his magic, makes
the head move, but as soon as he leaves the body it again becomes
lifeless. Peter, however, by his prayers effects a real resurrection.
Both are challenged to divine what the other is planning. Peter
prepares
blessed bread, and takes the emperor into the secret. Simon cannot
guess
what Peter has been doing, and so raises hell-hounds who rush on Peter,
but the presentation of the blessed bread causes them to vanish.</p>
<p>In the <i>Acts of Nereus and Achilleus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_75"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> another version of the story
is given. Simon had fastened a great dog at his door in order to
prevent
Peter entering. Peter by making the sign of the cross renders the dog
tame towards himself, but so furious against his master Simon that the
latter had to leave the city in disgrace.</p>
<p>Simon, however, still retains the emperor's favour by his magic
power.
He pretends to permit his head to be cut off, and by the power of
glamour appears to be decapitated, while the executioner really cuts
off
the head of a ram.</p>
<p>The last act of the drama is the erection of a wooden tower in the
Campus Martius, and Simon is to ascend to heaven in a chariot of fire.
But, through the prayers of Peter, the two daemons who were carrying
him
aloft let go their hold and so Simon perishes miserably.</p>
<p>Dr. Salmon connects this with the story, told by Suetonius<a
 name="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> and
Dio
Chrysostom,<a name="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a>
that Nero caused a wooden theatre to be erected in the
Campus, and that a gymnast who tried to play the part of Icarus fell so
near the emperor as to bespatter him with blood.</p>
<p>So much for these motley stories; here and there instructive, but
mostly
absurd. I shall now endeavour to sift out the rubbish from this
patristic and legendary heap, and perhaps we shall find more of value
than at present appears.</p>

the passages in the <i>Recognitions</i> and in Jerome's <i>Commentary
on
Matthew</i>, which I have already quoted. He also says that the author
of
the book, <i>De Divinis Nominibus</i> (C. 6), speaks of "the
controversial
sentences of Simon" (<span title="Simonos antirraetikoi logoi" lang="el">&#931;&#953;&#956;&#969;&#957;&#959;&#962;

is the Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, and I shall quote later on some
of these sentences, though from a very uncertain source. Cotelerius
also
refers to the Arabic Preface to the Nicaean Council. The text referred
to will be found in the Latin translation of Abrahamus Echellensis,

<h2>PART II.</h2>
<h2>A REVIEW OF AUTHORITIES.</h2>
<br />
<p>The student will at once perceive that though the Simon of the <i>Acts</i>
and the Simon of the fathers both retain the two features of the
possession of magical power and of collision with Peter, the tone of
the
narratives is entirely different. Though the apostles are naturally
shown as rejecting with indignation the pecuniary offer of the
thaumaturge, they display no hate for his personality, whereas the
fathers depict him as the vilest of impostors and charlatans and hold
him up to universal execration. The incident of Simon's offering money
to Peter is admittedly taken by the fathers from this account, and
therefore their repetition in no way corroborates the story. Hence its
authenticity rests entirely with the writer of the <i>Acts</i>, for
Justin,
who was a native of Samaria, does not mention it. As the <i>Acts</i>
are not
quoted from prior to A.D. 177, and their writer is only traditionally
claimed to be Luke, we may safely consider ourselves in the domain of
legend and not of history.</p>
<p>The same may be said of all the incidents of Simon's career; they
pertain to the region of fable and probably owe their creation to the
Patristic and Simonian controversies of later ages.</p>
<p>The Simon of Justin gives us the birthplace of Simon as at Gitta,
and
the rest of the fathers follow suit with variation of the name. Gitta,
Gittha, Gittoi, Gitthoi, Gitto, Gitton, Gitteh, so run the variants.
This, however, is a matter of no great importance, and the little burg
is said to-day to be called Gittho&iuml;.<a name="FNanchor_78"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>
<p>The statement of Justin as to the statue of Simon at Rome with the
inscription "SIMONI DEO SANCTO" has been called in question by every
scholar since the discovery in 1574 of a large marble fragment in the
island of the Tiber bearing the inscription "SEMONI SANCO DEO FIDIO," a
Sabine God. A few, however, think that Justin could not have made so
glaring a mistake in writing to the Romans, and that if it were a
mistake Iren&aelig;us would not have copied it. The coincidence,
however, is
too striking to bear any other interpretation than that perhaps some
ignorant controversialist had endeavoured to give the legend a
historical appearance, and that Justin had lent a too ready ear to him.
It is also to be noticed that Justin tells us that nearly all the
Samaritans were Simonians.</p>
<p>We next come to the Simon of Iren&aelig;us which, owing to many
similarities,
is supposed by scholars to have been taken from Justin's account, if
not
from the <i>Apology</i>, at any rate from Justin's lost work on
heresies
which he speaks of in the <i>Apology</i>. Or it may be that both
borrowed
from some common source now lost to us.</p>
<p>The story of Helen is here for the first time given. Whether or not
there was a Helen we shall probably never know. The "lost sheep" was a
necessity of every Gnostic system, which taught the descent of the soul
into matter. By whatever name called, whether Sophia, Acam&ocirc;th,
Prun&icirc;cus,
Barb&ecirc;lo, the glyph of the Magdalene, out of whom seven devils are
cast,
has yet to be understood, and the mystery of the Christ and the seven
aeons, churches or assemblies (<i>ecclesi&aelig;</i>), in every man
will not be
without significance to every student of Theosophy. These data are
common to all Gnostic aeonology.</p>
<p>If it is argued that Simon was the first inventor of this aeonology,
it
is astonishing that his name and that of Helen should not have had some
recognition in the succeeding systems. If, on the contrary, it is
maintained that he used existing materials for his system, and
explained
away his improper connection with Helen by an adaptation of the
Sophia-mythos, it is difficult to understand how such a palpable
absurdity could have gained any credence among such cultured adherents
as the Simonians evidently were. In either case the Gnostic tradition
is
shown to be pre-Christian. Every initiated Gnostic, however, must have
known that the mythos referred to the World-Soul in the Cosmos and the
Soul in man.</p>
<p>The accounts of the <i>Acts</i> and of Justin and Iren&aelig;us are
so confusing
that it has been supposed that two Simons are referred to.<a
 name="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> For
if he
claimed to be a re&iuml;ncarnation of Jesus, appearing in Jerusalem as
the
Son, he could not have been contemporary with the apostles. It follows,
therefore, that either he made no such claim; or if he made the claim,
Justin and Iren&aelig;us had such vague information that they confused
him
with the Simon of the <i>Acts</i>; or that the supposition is not
well-founded, and Simon was simply inculcating the esoteric doctrine of
the various manifestations or descents of one and the same Christ
principle.</p>
<p>The Simon of Tertullian again is clearly taken from Iren&aelig;us,
as the
critics are agreed. "Tertullian evidently knows no more than he read in
Iren&aelig;us," says Dr. Salmon.<a name="FNanchor_80"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>
<p>It is only when we come to the Simon of the <i>Philosophumena</i>
that we
feel on any safe ground. The prior part of it is especially precious on
account of the quotations from <i>The Great Revelation</i> (<span
 title="hae

megalae apophasis" lang="el">&#951; &#956;&#949;&#947;&#945;&#955;&#951; &#945;&#960;&#959;&#966;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>)
which we hear of from no other source. The author of
<i>Philosophumena</i>, whoever he was, evidently had access to some of
the
writings of the Simonians, and here at last we have arrived at any
thing
of real value in our rubbish heap.</p>
<p>It was not until the year 1842 that Minoides Mynas brought to Paris
from
Mount Athos, on his return from a commission given him by the French
Government, a fourteenth-century MS. in a mutilated condition. This was
the MS. of our <i>Philosophumena</i> which is supposed to have been
the work
of Hippolytus. The authorship, however, is still uncertain, as will
appear by what will be said about the Simon of Epiphanius and Philaster.</p>
<p>The latter part of the section on Simon in the <i>Philosophumena</i>
is not
so important, and is undoubtedly taken from Iren&aelig;us or from the
anti-heretical treatise of Justin, or from the source from which both
these fathers drew. The account of the death of Simon, however, shows
that the author was not Hippolytus from whose lost work Epiphanius and
Philaster are proved by Lipsius to have taken their accounts.</p>
<p>The Simon of Origen gives us no new information, except as to the
small
number of the Simonians. But like other data in his controversial
writings against the Gnostic philosopher Celsus we can place little
reliance on his statement, for Eusebius Pamphyli writing in A.D. 324-5,
a century afterwards, speaks of the Simonians as still considerable in
numbers.<a name="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>
<p>The Simon of Epiphanius and Philaster leads us to speak of a
remarkable
feat of scholarship performed by R.A. Lipsius,<a name="FNanchor_82"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> the learned professor
of divinity in the university of Jena. From their accounts he has
reconstructed to some extent a lost work of Hippolytus against heresies
of which a description was given by Photius. This treatise was founded
on certain discourses of Iren&aelig;us. By comparing Philaster,
Epiphanius,
and the Pseudo-Tertullian, he recovers Hippolytus, and by comparing his
restored Hippolytus with Iren&aelig;us he infers a common authority,
probably
the lost work of Justin Martyr, or, may we suggest, as remarked above,
the work from which Justin got his information.<a name="FNanchor_83"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a></p>
<p>The Simon of Theodoret differs from that of his predecessor only in
one
or two important details of the aeonology, a fact that has presumably
led Matter to suppose that he has introduced some later Gnostic ideas
or confused the teachings of the later Simonians with those of
Simon.<a name="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>
<p>The Simon of the legends is so entirely outside any historical
criticism, and the stories gleaned from the <i>Homilies</i> and
<i>Recognitions</i> are so evidently fabrications&#8212;most probably added
to the
doctrinal narrative at a later date&#8212;and so obviously the stock-in-trade
legends of magic, that not a solitary scholar supports their
authenticity. Probably one of the reasons for this is the strong
Ebionism of the narratives, which is by no means palatable to the
orthodox taste. In this connection the following table of the Ebionite
scheme of emanation may be of interest:<br />

<br />
<p>There remains but to mention the curious theory of Bauer and the
Tubingen school. It is now established by recent theological criticism
that the Clementine writings were the work of some member or members of
the Elkesaites, a sect of the Ebionites, and that they were written at
Rome somewhere in the third century. The Elkess&aelig;ans or Elkesaites
founded their creed on a book called <i>Elkesai</i>, which purported
to be an
angelic revelation and which was remarkable for its hostility to the
apostle Paul. As the <i>Recognitions</i> contain much anti-Paulinism,
Bauer
and his school not only pointed out the Ebionite source of the
Clementine literature, but also put forward the theory that whenever
Simon Magus is mentioned Paul is intended; and that the narrative of
the
<i>Acts</i> and the legends simply tell the tale of the jealousy of the
elder
apostles to Paul, and their attempt to keep him from the fullest
enjoyment of apostolic privileges. But the latest scholarship shakes
its
head gravely at the theory, and however bitter controversialists the
anti-Paulinists may have been, it is not likely that they would have
gone so far out of their way to vent their feelings in so grotesque a
fashion.</p>
<p>In conclusion of this Part let us take a general review of our
authorities with regard to the life of Simon and the immoral practices
attributed to his followers, including a few words of notice on the
lost
Simonian literature, and reserving the explanation of his system and
some notice of magical practices for Part III.</p>
<p>I have distinguished the Simon of the fathers from the Simon of the
legends, as to biography, "by convention" and not "by nature," as the
Simonians would say, for the one and the other is equally on a mythical
basis. It is easy to understand that the rejection of the Simon of the
legends is a logical necessity for those who have to repudiate the
Ebionite Clementines. Admit the authenticity of the narrative as
regards
Simon, and the authenticity of the other incidents about John the
Baptist and Peter would have to be acknowledged; but this would never
do, so Simon escapes from the clutches of his orthodox opponents as far
as this count is concerned.</p>
<p>But the biographical incidents in the fathers are of a similar
nature
precisely to those in the Clementines, and their sources of information
are so vague and unreliable, and at such a distance from the time of
their supposed occurrence, that we have every reason to place them in
the same category with the Clementine legends. Therefore, whether we
reject the evidence or accept it, we must reject both accounts or
accept
both. To reject the one and accept the other is a prejudice that a
partisan may be guilty of, but a position which no unbiassed enquirer
can with justice take up.</p>
<p>The legends, however, may find some excuse when it is remembered
that
they were current in a period when the metal of religious controversy
was glowing at white heat. Orthodox Christians had their ears still
tingling with the echoing of countless accusations of the foulest
nature
to which they had been subjected. Not a crime that was known or could
be
imagined that had not been brought against them; they naturally,
therefore, returned the compliment when they could do so with safety,
and though in these more peaceful and tolerant days much as we may
regret the flinging backwards and forwards of such vile accusations, we
may still find some excuse for it in the passionate enthusiasm of the
times, always, however, remembering that the readiest in accusation and
in putting the worst construction on the actions of others, is
generally
one who unconsciously brings a public accusation against his own lower
nature.</p>
<p>This has been well noticed by Matter, who writes as follows:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>"There is nothing so impure," says Eusebius, "and one cannot imagine
anything so criminal, but the sect of the Simonians goes far beyond it."<a
 name="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>
<p> The bolt of Eusebius is strong; it is even too strong; for one can
imagine nothing that goes beyond the excess of criminality; and
Eusebius, belonging to a community who were just escaping from
punishments into which accusations no less grave had caused them to be
dragged, should not perhaps have allowed himself to speak as he does.
But man is made thus; he pursues when he ceases to be pursued.<a
 name="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p>All societies that have secret rites and a public position, as was
the
case with all the early communities of Christians and Gnostics, have
had
like accusations brought against them. The communities of the Simonians
and Christians may or may not have been impure, it is now impossible to
pronounce a positive opinion. The important point to notice is that the
accusations being identical and the evidence or want of evidence the
same, condemnation or acquittal must be meted out to both; and that if
one is condemned and the other acquitted, the judgment will stand
condemned as biassed, and therefore be set aside by those who prefer
truth to prejudice.</p>
<p>So eager were the fathers to discredit Simon that they contradict
themselves in the most flagrant fashion on many important points. On
the
one hand we hear that Samaria received the seed of the Word from the
apostles and Simon in despair had to flee, on the other hand Justin, a
native of Samaria, tells us, a century after this supposed event, that
nearly all the Samaritans are Simonians. The accounts of Simon's death
again are contradictory; if Simon perished so miserably at Rome, it is
the reverse of probable that the Romans would have set up a statue in
his honour. But, indeed, it is a somewhat thankless task to criticize
such manifest inventions; we know the source of their inspiration, and
we know the fertility of the religious imagination, especially in
matters of controversy, and this is a sufficient sieve wherewith to
sift
them out of our heap.</p>
<p>I must now say a few words on Simonian literature of which the only
geniune specimens we can in any way be certain are the quotations from
the <i>Apophasis</i> of Simon in the text of the <i>Philosophumena</i>.</p>
<p>That there was a body of Simonian scriptures is undoubtedly true, as
may
be seen from the passages we have quoted from the <i>Recognitions</i>,
Jerome, Pseudo-Dionysius and the Arabic Preface to the Nicaean Council,
and for some time I was in hopes of being able to collect at least some
scattered fragments of these works, but they have all unfortunately
shared the fate of much else of value that the ignorance and fear of
orthodoxy has committed to the flames. We know at any rate that there
was a book called <i>The Four Quarters of the World</i>, just as the
four
orthodox gospels are dedicated to the signs of the four quarters in the
old MSS., and that a collection of sentences or controversial replies
of
Simon were also held in repute by Simonians and were highly distasteful
to their opponents. Matter<a name="FNanchor_88"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a> and Am&eacute;lineau<a
 name="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a>
speak of a book by the
disciples of Simon called <i>De la Pr&eacute;dication de S. Paul</i>,
but neither
from their references nor elsewhere can I find out any further
information. In Migne's <i>Encyclop&eacute;die Th&eacute;ologique</i>,<a
 name="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a>
also, a
reference is given to M. Miller (<i>Catalogue des Manuscripts Grecs de
l'Escurial</i>, p. 112), who is said to mention a Greek MS. on the
subject
of Simon ("un &eacute;crit en grec relatif &agrave; Simon"). But I
cannot find this
catalogue in the British Museum, nor can I discover any other mention
of
this MS. in any other author.</p>
<p>At last I thought that I had discovered something of real value in
Grabe's <i>Spicilegium</i>, purporting to be gleanings of fragments
from the
heretics of the first three centuries A.D.,<a name="FNanchor_91"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a> but the date of the
authority is too late to be of much value. Grabe refers to the
unsatisfactory references I have already given and, to show the nature
of these books, according to the opinion of the unknown author or
authors of the <i>Apostolic Constitutions</i> (Grabe calls him the
"collector," and for some reason best known to himself places him in
the
fourth century<a name="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a>),
quotes the following passage from their legendary
pages.</p>
<p>"Such were the doings of these people with names of ill-omen
slandering
the creation and marriage, providence, child-bearing, the Law and the
Prophets; setting down foreign names of Angels, as indeed they
themselves say, but in reality, of Daemons, who answer back to them
from
below."</p>
<p>It is only when Grabe refers to the Simonian <i>Antirrh&ecirc;tikoi
Logoi</i>,
mentioned by the Pseudo-Dionysius, which he calls "vesani Simonis
Refutatorii Sermones," that we get any new information.</p>
<p>A certain Syrian bishop, Moses Barcephas, writing in the tenth
century,<a name="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a>
professes to preserve some of these controversial retorts
of Simon, which the pious Grabe&#8212;to keep this venom, as he calls it,
apart from the orthodox refutation&#8212;has printed in italics. The
following is the translation of these italicized passages:</p>
<p>"God willed that Adam should not eat of that tree; but he did eat;
he,
therefore, did not remain as God willed him to remain: it results,
therefore, that the maker of Adam was impotent."</p>
<p>"God willed that Adam should remain in Paradise; but he of his own
disgraceful act fell from thence: therefore the God that made Adam was
impotent, inasmuch as he was unable of his own will to keep him in
Paradise."</p>
<p>"(For) he interdicted (he said) Adam from the tree of the knowledge
of
good and evil, by tasting which he would have had power to judge
between
good and evil, and to avoid this, and follow after that."</p>
<p>"But (said he) had not that maker of Adam forbidden him to eat of
that
tree, he would in no way have undergone this judgment and this
punishment; for hence is evil here, in that he (Adam) had done contrary
to the bidding of God, for God had ordered him not to eat, and he had
eaten."</p>
<p>"Through envy (said he) he forbade Adam to taste of the tree of
life, so
that, of course, he should not be immortal."</p>
<p>"For what reason on earth (said he) did God curse the serpent? For
if
(he cursed him) as the one who caused the harm, why did he not restrain
him from so doing, that is, from seducing Adam? But if (he cursed him)
as one who had brought some advantage, in that he was the cause of
Adam's eating of that good tree, it needs must follow that he was
distinctly unrighteous and envious; lastly, if, although from neither
of
these reasons, he still cursed him, he (the maker of Adam) should most
certainly be accused of ignorance and folly."</p>
<p>Now although there seems no reason why the above contentions should
not
be considered as in substance the arguments employed by Simon against
his antagonists of the dead-letter, yet the tenth century is too late
to
warrant verbal accuracy, unless there may have been some Syrian
translation which escaped the hands of the destroyers. The above quoted
specimen of traditionary Simonian logic, however, is interesting, and
will, we believe, be found not altogether out of date in our own
times.<a name="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a></p>
<p>Finally, there is one further point that I have reserved for the end
of
this Part in order that my readers may constantly keep it in mind
during
the perusal of the Part which follows.</p>
<p>We must always remember that every single syllable we possess about
Simon comes from the hands of bitter opponents, from men who had no
mercy or toleration for the heretic. The heretic was accursed,
condemned
eternally by the very fact of his heresy; an emissary of Satan and the
natural enemy of God. There was no hope for him, no mercy for him; he
was irretrievably damned.<a name="FNanchor_95"></a><a

has no
friend; no one to say a word in his favour; he is hounded down the
byways of "history" and the highways of tradition, and to crush him is
to do God service. One solitary ray of light beams forth in the
fragment
of his work called <i>The Great Revelation</i>, one solitary ray, that
will
illumine the garbled accounts of his doctrine, and speak to the
Theosophists of to-day in no uncertain tones that each may say:</p>

<a name="PART_III"></a>
<h2>PART III.</h2>
<h2>THE THEOSOPHY OF SIMON.</h2>
<br />
<p>In treating of eschatology and the beginning of things the human
mind is
ever beset with the same difficulties, and no matter how grand may be
the effort of the intellect to transcend itself, the finite must ever
fail to comprehend the infinite. How much less then can words define
that which even the whole phenomenal universe fails to express! The
change from the One to the Many is not to be described. How the
All-Deity becomes the primal Trinity, is the eternal problem set for
man's solution. No system of religion or philosophy has ever explained
this inexplicable mystery, for it cannot be understood by the embodied
Soul, whose vision and comprehension are dulled by the grossness of its
physical envelope. Even the illuminated Soul that quits its prison
house, to bathe in the light of infinitude, can only recollect flashes
of the Vision Glorious once it returns again to earth.</p>
<p>And this is also the teaching of Simon when he says:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>I say there are many gods, but one God of all these gods,
incomprehensible and unknown to all, ... a Power of immeasurable and
ineffable Light, whose greatness is held to be incomprehensible, a
Tower which the maker of the world does not know.</p>
</div>
<p>This is a fundamental dogma of the Gn&ocirc;sis in all climes and in
all ages.
The demiurgic deity is not the All-Deity, for there is an infinite
succession of universes, each having its particular deity, its
Brahm&acirc;,
to use the Hind&ucirc; term, but this Brahm&acirc; is not THAT which is
Para-Brahman, that which is beyond Brahm&acirc;.</p>
<p>This view of the Simonian Gn&ocirc;sis has been magnificently
anticipated in
the <i>Rig Veda</i> (x. 129) which reads in the fine translation of
Colebrooke as follows:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>That, whence all this great creation came,<br />
</span><span>Whether Its will created or was mute,<br />
</span><span>The Most High Seer that is in highest Heaven,<br />
</span><span>He knows it&#8212;or perchance even He knows not.<br />
</span></div>
</div>
<p>In treating of emanation, evolution, creation or whatever other term
may
be given to the process of manifestation, therefore, the teachers deal
only with one particular universe; the Unmanifested Root, and Universal
Cause of all Universes lying behind, in potentiality (<span
 title="dynamis" lang="el">&#948;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962;</span>),
in Incomprehensible Silence (<span title="sigae akatalaeptos" lang="el">&#963;&#953;&#947;&#951;
&#945;&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#955;&#951;&#960;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>). For on the
"Tongue of the Ineffable" are many "Words" (<span title="logoi"
 lang="el">&#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#953;</span>), each
Universe having its own Logos.</p>
<p>Thus then Simon speaks of the Logos of this Universe and calls it
Fire
<span title="pyr" lang="el">&#960;&#965;&#961;</span>). This is the Universal
Principle or Beginning
(<span title="ton holon archae" lang="el">&#964;&#969;&#957; &#959;&#955;&#969;&#957; &#945;&#961;&#967;&#951;</span>), or
Universal Rootage (<span title="rizoma ton holon" lang="el">&#961;&#953;&#950;&#969;&#956;&#945; &#964;&#969;&#957;
&#959;&#955;&#969;&#957;</span>).
But this Fire is not the fire of earth; it is Divine Light and Life and
Mind, the Perfect Intellectual (<span title="to teleion noeron"
 lang="el">&#964;&#959; &#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#957;&#959;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span>). It is the
One Power, "generating itself, increasing itself, seeking itself,
finding itself, its own mother, its own father, its sister, its spouse:
the daughter, son, mother, and father of itself; One, the Universal
Root." It is That, "which has neither beginning nor end, existing in
oneness." "Producing itself by itself, it manifested to itself its own
Thought (<span title="epinoia" lang="el">&#949;&#960;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945;</span>)."</p>
<p>It is quite true that this symbology of Fire is not original with
Simon, but there is also no reason to suppose that the Samaritan
teacher plagiarized from Heracleitus when we know that the major part
of
antiquity regarded fire and the sun as the most fitting symbols of
Deity. Of the manifested elements, fire was the most potent, and
therefore the most fitting symbol that could be selected in manifested
nature.</p>
<p>But what was the Fire of Heracleitus, the Obscure (<span
 title="ho

skoteinos" lang="el">&#959; &#963;&#954;&#959;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>), as Cicero, with
the rest of the ancients, called him,
because of his difficult style? What was the Universal Principle of the
"weeping philosopher," the pessimist who valued so little the
estimation
of the vulgar (<span title="ochloloidoros" lang="el">&#959;&#967;&#955;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#953;&#948;&#959;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>)?
It certainly was no common
"fire," certainly no puerile concept to be brushed away by the mere
hurling of an epithet.</p>
<p>Heracleitus of Ephesus (<i>flor. c.</i> 503 B.C.) was a sincerely
religious
man in the highest sense of the word, a reformer who strongly opposed
the degenerate polytheism and idolatry of his age; he insisted on the
impermanence of the phenomenal universe, of human affairs, beliefs and
opinions, and declared the One Eternal Reality; teaching that the Self
of man was a portion of the Divine Intelligence. The object of his
enquiry was Wisdom, and he reproached his vain-glorious countrymen of
the city of Diana with the words: "Your <i>knowledge</i> of many
things does
not give you <i>wisdom</i>."</p>
<p>In his philosophy of nature he declared the One Thing to be Fire,
but
Fire of a mystical nature, "self-kindled and self-extinguished," the
vital quickening power of the universe. It was that Universal Life, by
participation in which all things have their being, and apart from
which
they are unsubstantial and unreal. This is the "Tree of Life" spoken of
by Simon.</p>
<p>In this Ocean of Fire or Life&#8212;in every point or atom of it&#8212;is
inherent
a longing to manifest itself in various forms, thus giving rise to the
perpetual flux and change of the phenomenal world. This Divine Desire,
this "love for everything that lives and breathes," is found in many
systems, and especially in the Vedic and Phoenician Cosmogony. In the
<i>Rig Veda</i> (x. 129), it is that K&acirc;ma or Desire "which first
arose in It
(the Unknown Deity)," elsewhere identified with Agni or Fire. In the
fragments of Phoenician Cosmogony, recovered from Sanchuniathon, it is
called Pothos (<span title="pothos" lang="el">&#960;&#959;&#952;&#959;&#962;</span>) and
Er&ocirc;s (<span title="eros" lang="el">&#949;&#961;&#969;&#962;</span>).</p>
<p>In its pure state, the Living and Rational Fire of Heracleitus
resides
in the highest conceivable Heaven, whence it descends stage by stage,
gradually losing the velocity of its motion and vitality, until it
finally reaches the Earth-stage, having previously passed through that
of "Water." Thence it returns to its parent source.</p>
<p>In this eternal flux, the only repose was to be found in the harmony
that occasionally resulted from one portion of the Fire in its descent
meeting another in its ascent. All this took place under Law and Order,
and the Soul of man being a portion of the Fire in its pure state, and
therefore an exile here on Earth, could only be at rest by cultivating
as the highest good, contentment (<span title="euarestaesis" lang="el">&#949;&#965;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>,
or
acquiescence to the Law.</p>
<p>The author of the <i>Philosophumena</i> professes to give us some
additional
information on this philosopher who "bewailed all things, condemning
the
ignorance of all that lives, and of all men, in pity for the life of
mortals," but the obscure philosopher does not lend himself very easily
to the controversial purposes of the patristic writer. Heracleitus
called the Universal Principle (<span title="ton hapanton archae"
 lang="el">&#964;&#969;&#957; &#945;&#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#945;&#961;&#967;&#951;</span>)
Intellectual Fire (<span title="pur noeron" lang="el">&#960;&#965;&#961; &#957;&#959;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span>),
and said that the sphere
surrounding us and reaching to the Moon was filled with evil, but
beyond
the Moon-sphere it was purer.<a name="FNanchor_97"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>
<p>The sentences that the author quotes from Heracleitus in Book IX,
are
not only obscure enough in themselves, but are also rendered all the
more obscure by the polemical treatment they are subjected to by the
patristic writer. Heracleitus makes the ALL inclusive of all Being and
Non-Being, all pairs of opposites, "differentiation and
non-differentiation, the generable and ingenerable, mortal and
immortal,
the Logos and Aeon, and the Father and Son," which he calls the "Just
God." This ALL is the "Sadasat-Tatparam yat" of the <i>Bhagavad
G&icirc;t&acirc;</i>,
inclusive of Being (Sat), Non-Being (Asat), and That Which transcends
them (Tatparam yat).<a name="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a></p>
<p>This Logos plays an important part in the system of the Ephesian
sage,
who says that they who give ear to the Logos (the Word or Supreme
Reason) know that "All is One" (<span title="hen panta eidenai"
 lang="el">&#949;&#957; &#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#949;&#953;&#948;&#949;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span>). Such an
admission he calls, "Reflex Harmony" (<span
 title="palintropos harmoniae" lang="el">&#960;&#945;&#955;&#953;&#957;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#962; &#945;&#961;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#953;&#951;</span>),
like unto the Supernal Harmony, which he calls Hidden or Occult, and
declares its superiority to the Manifested Harmony. The ignorance and
misery of men arise from their not acting according to this Harmony,
that is to say, according to (Divine) Nature (<span title="kata phusin"
 lang="el">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#966;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span>).</p>
<p>He also declares that the Aeon, the Emanative Deity, is as a child
playing at creation, an idea found in both the Hind&ucirc; and Hermetic
Scriptures. In the former the Universe is said to be the sport
(L&icirc;l&acirc;) of
Vishnu, who is spoken of in one of his incarnations as
L&icirc;l&acirc;vat&acirc;ra,
descending on earth for his own pleasure, when as Krishna he assumed
the
shape of man as a pretence (a purely Docetic doctrine), hence called
L&icirc;l&acirc;-m&acirc;nusha-vigraha; while in the latter we learn
from a magic papyrus
that Thoth (the God of Wisdom) created the world by bursting into
"seven
peals of laughter." This, of course, typifies the Bliss of the Deity in
Emanation or Creation, caused by that Divine Love and Compassion for
all
that lives and breathes, which is the well-spring of the Supreme Cause
of the Universe.</p>
<p>Diving into the Mystery of Being, Heracleitus showed how a thing
could
be good or evil, and evil or good, at one and the same time, as for
instance sea water which preserved and nourished fishes but destroyed
men. So also, speaking in his usual paradoxical manner, which can only
be understood by a full comprehension of the dual nature of man,&#8212;the
real divine entity, and the passing and ever-changing manifestation,
which so many take for the whole man&#8212;he says:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>The immortals are mortal, and the mortals immortal, the former
living the death of the latter, and the latter dying the life of the
former.<a name="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p>Thus all externals are transitory, for "no one has ever been twice
on
the same stream, for different waters are constantly flowing down," and
therefore in following externals we shall err, for nothing is efficient
and forcible except through Harmony, and its subjection to the Divine
Fire, the central principle of Life.</p>
<p>Such was the Fire of the distinguished Ephesian, and of like nature
was
the Fire of Simon with its three primordial hypostases, Incorruptible
Form (<span title="aphthartos morphae" lang="el">&#945;&#966;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#956;&#959;&#961;&#966;&#951;</span>),
Universal Mind (<span title="nous ton

holon" lang="el">&#957;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#964;&#969;&#957; &#959;&#955;&#969;&#957;</span>),
and Great Thought (<span title="epinoia megalae" lang="el">&#949;&#960;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945;
&#956;&#949;&#947;&#945;&#955;&#951;</span>), synthesized as
the Universal Logos, He who has stood, stands and will stand (<span
 title="ho

estos, stas, staesomenos" lang="el">&#959; &#949;&#963;&#964;&#969;&#962;, &#963;&#964;&#945;&#962;,
&#963;&#964;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>).</p>
<p>But before passing on to the aeonology of Simon, a short delay, to
enquire more fully into the notions of the Initiated among the ancients
as to the nature of Mystic Fire, will not be without advantage.</p>
<p>If Simon was a Samaritan and learned in the esoteric interpretation
of
scripture, he could not have failed to be acquainted with the Kabalah,
perhaps even with the now lost Chald&aelig;an <i>Book of Numbers</i>.
Among the
books of the Kabalah, the <i>Zohar</i>, or "Book of Splendour," speaks
of the
mysterious "Hidden Light," that which Simon calls the Hidden Fire
(<span title="to krupton" lang="el">&#964;&#959; &#954;&#961;&#965;&#960;&#964;&#959;&#957;</span>), and tells us of
the "Mystery of the Three Parts
of the Fire, which are One" as follows:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>Began Rabbi Sim-on and said: Two verses are written, "That YHVH thy
Elohim is a devouring fire, a zealous Ail (El)" (<i>Deut.</i>, iv. 24);
again it is written, "But you that cleave unto YHVH your Elohim, are
alive, every one of you, this day" (<i>Deut.</i>, iv. 4). On this verse
"That YHVH thy Elohim is a consuming fire," this we said to the
companions; That it is a fire which devours fire, and it is a fire
which devours itself and consumes itself, because it is a fire which is
more mighty than fire, and it has been so confirmed. But, Come, See!
Whoever desires to know the wisdom of the Holy Unity should look in
that flame arising from a burning coal or a lighted lamp. This flame
comes out only when united with another thing. Come, See! In the flame
which goes up are two lights: one light is a bright white and one light
is united with a dark or blue; the white light is that which is above
and ascends in a straight path, and that below is that dark or blue
light, and this light below is the throne to the white light and that
white light rests upon it, and they unite one to the other so that they
are one. And this dark light, or blue colour, which is below, is the
precious throne to the white. And this is the mystery of the blue. And
this blue dark throne unites itself with another thing to light that
from below, and this awakes it to unite with the upper white light, and
this blue or dark, sometimes changes its colour, but that white above
never changes its colour, it is always white; but that blue changes to
these different colours, sometimes to blue or black and sometimes to a
red colour, and this unites itself to two sides. It unites to the
above, to that white upper light, and unites itself below to the thing
which is under it, which is the burning matter, and this burns and
consumes always from the matter below. And this devours that matter
below, which connects with it and upon which the blue light rests,
therefore this eats up all which connects with it from below, because
it is the nature of it, that it devour and consume everything which
depends on it and is dead matter, and therefore it eats up everything
which connects with it below, and this white light which rests upon it
never consumes itself and never changes its light, and therefore said
Moses; "That YHVH thy Elohim is a consuming fire." Surely He consumes.
It devours and consumes every thing which rests under it; and on this
he said: "YHVH is thy Elohim" not "our Elohim," because Moses has been
in that white light, Above, which neither devours nor consumes. Come,
See! It is not His Will to light that blue light that should unite with
that white light, only for Isra&euml;l; because they cleave or connect
under Him. And, Come, See! Although the nature of that dark or blue
light is, that it shall consume every thing which joins with it below,
still Isra&euml;l cleaves on Him, Below, ... and although you cleave in
Him nevertheless you exist, because it is written: "You are all alive
this day." And on this white light rests above a Hidden Light which is
stronger. Here is the above mystery of that flame which comes out from
it, and in it is the Wisdom of the Above.<a name="FNanchor_100"></a><a

fashioner of the Fiery Cosmos is the Mind of Mind.<a name="FNanchor_103"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p>A striking similarity with the Simonian system, indeed, rendered all
the
closer by the Oracle which speaks of that:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>Which first leaped forth from Mind, enveloping Fire with Fire,
binding them together that it might interblend the mother-vortices,<a
 name="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104"><sup>[104]</sup></a>
while retaining the flower of its own Fire.<a name="FNanchor_105"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p>This "flower" of Fire and the vorticle idea is further explained by
the
Oracle which says:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>Thence a trailing whirlwind, the flower of shadowy Fire, leaping
into the wombs (or hollows) of worlds. For thence it is that all things
begin to stretch below their wondrous rays.<a name="FNanchor_106"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p>Compare this with the teaching of Simon that the "fruit" of the Tree
is
placed in the Store-house and not cast into the Fire.</p>
<p>In his aeonology, Simon, like other Gnostic teachers, begins with
the
Word, the Logos, which springs up from the Depths of the
Unknown&#8212;Invisible, Incomprehensible Silence. It is true that he does
not so name the Great Power, He who has stood, stands and will stand;
but that which comes forth from Silence is Speech, and the idea is the
same whatever the terminology employed may be. Setting aside the
Hermetic teachings and those of the later Gn&ocirc;sis, we find this
idea of
the Great Silence referred to several times in the fragments of the
Chald&aelig;an Oracles. It is called "God-nourished Silence" <span
 title="sigae

theothremmon" lang="el">&#963;&#953;&#947;&#951; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#952;&#961;&#949;&#956;&#956;&#969;&#957;</span>),
according to whose divine decrees the Mind that
energizes before all energies, abides in the Paternal Depth.<a
 name="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107"><sup>[107]</sup></a>
Again:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>This unswerving Deity is called the Silent One by the gods, and is
said to consent (lit. sing together) with the Mind, and to be known by
the Souls through Mind alone.<a name="FNanchor_108"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_108"><sup>[108]</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p>Elsewhere the Oracles demonstrate this Power which is prior to the
highest Heaven as "Mystic Silence."<a name="FNanchor_109"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_109"><sup>[109]</sup></a></p>
<p>The Word, then, issuing from Silence is first a Monad, then a Duad,
a
Triad and a Hebdomad. For no sooner has differentiation commenced in
it,
and it passes from the state of Oneness (<span title="monotaes"
 lang="el">&#956;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#964;&#951;&#962;</span>), than the
Duadic and Triadic state immediately supervene, arising, so to say,
simultaneously in the mind, for the mind cannot rest on Duality, but is
forced by a law of its nature to rest only on the joint emanation of
the
Two. Thus the first natural resting point is the Trinity. The next is
the Hebdomad or Septenary, according to the mathematical formula
2<sup>n</sup>-1, the sum of <i>n</i> things taken 1, 2, 3 ... <i>n</i>,
at a time. The
Trinity being manifested, <i>n</i> here =3; and 2<sup>3</sup>-1 = 7.</p>
<p>Thus Simon has six Roots and the Seventh Power, seven in all, as the
type of the Aeons in the Pler&ocirc;ma. These all proceed from the
Fire. In
like manner also the Cabeiric deities of Samothrace and Phoenicia were
Fire-gods, born of the Fire. Nonnus tells us they were sons of the
mysterious Hephaestus (Vulcan),<a name="FNanchor_110"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_110"><sup>[110]</sup></a> and Eusebius, in his
quotations
from Sanchuniathon, that they were <i>seven</i> in number.<a
 name="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a>
The Vedic
Agni (Ignis) also, the God of Fire, is called "Seven-tongued"
(Sapta-jihva) and "Seven-flamed" (Sapta-jv&acirc;la).<a
 name="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a></p>
<p>In the <i>Hibbert Lectures</i> of 1887, Prof. A.H. Sayce gives the
following
Hymn of Ancient Babylonia to the Fire-god, from <i>The Cuneiform
Inscriptions of Western Asia</i> (iv. 15):</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>1. The (bed) of the earth they took for their border, but the god
appeared not,</p>
<p> 2. from the foundations of the earth he appeared not to make
hostility;</p>
<p> 3. (to) the heaven below they extended (their path), and to the
heaven that is unseen they climbed afar.</p>
<p> 4. In the Star(s) of Heaven was not their ministry; in Mazzaroth
(the Zodiacal signs) was their office.</p>
<p> 5. The Fire-god, the first-born supreme, into heaven they pursued
and no father did he know.</p>
<p> 6. O Fire-god, supreme on high, the first-born, the mighty, supreme
enjoiner of the commands of Anu!</p>
<p> 7. The Fire-god enthrones with himself the friend that he loves.</p>
<p> 8. He reveals the enmity of those seven.</p>
<p> 9. On the work he ponders in his dwelling-place.</p>
<p> 10. O Fire-god, how were those seven begotten, how were they
nurtured?</p>
<p> 11. Those seven in the mountain of the sunset were born;</p>
<p> 12. those seven in the mountain of the sunrise grew up.</p>
<p> 13. In the hollows of the earth they have their dwelling;</p>
<p> 14. on the high places of the earth their names are proclaimed.</p>
<p> 15. As for them, in heaven and earth they have no dwelling, hidden
is their name.</p>
<p> 16. Among the sentient gods they are not known.</p>
<p> 17. Their name in heaven and earth exists not.</p>
<p> 18. Those seven from the mountain of the sunset gallop forth;</p>
<p> 19. those seven in the mountain of the sunrise are bound to rest.</p>
<p> 20. In the hollows of the earth they set the foot.</p>
<p> 21. On the high places of the earth they lift the neck.</p>

knowledge of them.<a name="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p>Though I have no intention of contending that Simon obtained his
ideas
specifically from Vedic, Chald&aelig;an, Babylonian, Zoroastrian, or
Phoenician sources, still the identity of ideas and the probability,
almost amounting to conviction for the student, that the Initiated of
antiquity all drew from the same sources, shows that there was nothing
original in the main features of the Simonian system.</p>
<p>This is also confirmed by the statements in Epiphanius and the
<i>Apostolic Constitutions</i> that the Simonians gave "barbarous" or
"foreign names" to their Aeons. That is to say, names that were neither
Greek nor Hebrew. None of these names are mentioned by the Fathers, and
probably the Greek terms given by the author of the <i>Philosophumena</i>
and
Theodoret are exoteric equivalents of the mystery names. There is
abundant evidence, from gems, monuments and fragments, to show that
there was a mystery language employed by the Gnostic and other schools.
What this language was no scholar has yet been able to tell us, and it
is sufficiently evident that the efforts at decipherment are so far
abortive. The fullest and most precious examples of these names and of
this language are to be found in the papyri brought back by Bruce from
Abyssinia at the latter end of the last century.<a name="FNanchor_114"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a></p>
<p>Jamblichus tells us that the language of the Mysteries was that of
ancient Egypt and Assyria, which he calls "sacred nations," as follows:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>But, you ask, why among our symbolical terms (<span
 title="saemantika" lang="el">&#963;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#945;</span>) we prefer barbarous
(words) to our respective native (tongues)? There is also for this a
mystic reason. For it was the gods who taught the sacred nations, such
as the Egyptians and Assyrians, the whole of their sacred dialect,
wherefore we think that we ought to make our own dialects resemble the
speech cognate with the gods. Since also the first mode of speech in
antiquity was of such a nature, and especially since they who learnt
the first names concerning the gods, mingled them with their own
tongue&#8212;as being suited to such (names) and conformable to them&#8212;and
handed them down to us, we therefore keep unchanged the rule of this
immemorial tradition to our own times. For of all things that are
suited to the gods the most akin is manifestly that which is eternal
and immutable.<a name="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p>The existence of this sacred tongue perhaps accounts for the
constant
distinction made by Homer between the language of the gods and that of
men.<a name="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116"><sup>[116]</sup></a>
Diodorus Siculus also asserts that the Samothracians used a
very ancient and peculiar dialect in their sacred rites.<a
 name="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a></p>
<p>These "barbarous names" were regarded as of the greatest efficacy
and
sanctity, and it was unlawful to change them. As the Chald&aelig;an
Logia say:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>Change not the barbarous names, for in all the nations are there
names given by the gods, possessing unspeakable power in the Mysteries.<a
 name="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p>And the scholiast<a name="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119"><sup>[119]</sup></a>
adds that they should not be translated into
Greek.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, most probable that Simon used the one, three,
five,
and seven syllabled or vowelled names, and that the Greek terms were
substitutes that completely veiled the esoteric meaning from the
uninitiated.</p>
<p>The names of the seven Aeons, as given by the author of the
<i>Philosophumena</i>, are as follows: The Image from the Incorruptible
Form,
alone ordering all things (<span

also called Sun (<span title="haelios" lang="el">&#951;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>) and Moon
(<span title="selaenae" lang="el">&#963;&#949;&#955;&#951;&#957;&#951;</span>); Reason
(<span title="logismos" lang="el">&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#962;</span>) and Reflection (<span
 title="enthumaesis" lang="el">&#949;&#957;&#952;&#965;&#956;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>), also called
Air (<span title="aaer" lang="el">&#945;&#951;&#961;</span>) and Water (<span
 title="hudor" lang="el">&#965;&#948;&#959;&#961;</span>).</p>
<p>The first three of these are sufficiently explained in the fragment
of
Simon's <i>Great Revelation</i>, preserved in the <i>Philosophumena</i>,
and
become entirely comprehensible to the student of the Kabalah who is
learned in the emanations of the Sephirothal Tree. Mind and Thought are
evidently Chokmah and Binah, and the three and seven Sephiroth are to
be
clearly recognized in the scheme of the Simonian System which is to
follow.</p>
<p>Of the two lower Syzygies, or Lower Quaternary of the Aeons, we have
no
details from the Fathers. We may, however, see some reason for the
exoteric names&#8212;Voice and Name, Reason and Reflection&#8212;from the
following considerations:</p>
<p>(1) We should bear in mind what has already been said about the
Logos,
Speech and Divine Names. (2) In the Septenary the Quaternary represents
the Manifested and the Triad the Concealed Side of the Fire. (3) The
fundamental characteristics of the manifested universe with the
Hind&ucirc;s
and Buddhists are Name (N&acirc;ma) and Form (R&ucirc;pa). (4) Simon
says that the
Great Power was not called Father until Thought (in manifestation
becoming Voice) <i>named</i> (<span title="onomasai" lang="el">&#959;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#963;&#945;&#953;</span>)
him Father. (5) Reason and
Reflection are evidently the two lowest aspects, principles, or
characteristics, of the <i>divine</i> Mind of man. These are included
in the
lower mind, or Internal Organ (Antah-karana), by the Ved&acirc;ntin
philosophers of India and called Buddhi and Manas, being respectively
the mental faculties used in the certainty of judgment and the doubt of
enquiry.</p>
<p>This Quaternary, among a host of other things, typifies the four
lower
planes, elements, principles, aspects, etc., of the Universe, with
their
Hierarchies of Angels, Archangels, Rulers, etc., each synthesized by a
Lord who is supreme in his own domain. Seeing, however, that the
outermost physical plane is so vast that it transcends the power of
conception of even the greatest intellect, it is useless for us to
speculate on the interplay of cosmic forces and the mysterious
interaction of Spheres of Being that transcend all normal human
consciousness. It is only on the lowest and outermost plane that the
lower Quaternary symbolizes the four Cardinal Points. The Michael
(Sun),
Gabriel (Moon), Uriel (Venus), and Raphael (Mercury) of the Kabalah,
the
four Beasts, the Wheels of Ezekiel, were living, divine, and
intelligent
Entities pertaining to the inner nature of man and the universe for the
Initiated.</p>
<p>It is to be presumed that the Simonians had distinct teachings on
this
point, as is evidenced by the title of their lost work, <i>The Book of
the
Four Angles and Points of the World</i>. The Four Angles were probably
connected with the four ducts or Streams of the "River going forth from
Eden to water the Garden." These Streams have their analogy on all
planes, and cosmically are of the same nature as the
&Acirc;k&acirc;sha-Gang&acirc;&#8212;the
Ganges in the Ak&acirc;shic Ocean of Space&#8212;and the rest of the Rivers
in the
Paur&acirc;nic writings of the Hind&ucirc;s.</p>
<p>But before going further it will be as well to have a Diagram or
Scheme
of the Simonian Aeonology, for presumably the School of Simon had such
a
Scheme, as we know the Ophites had from the work of Origen, <i>Contra
Celsum</i>.</p>
<img alt="DIAGRAM OF THE SIMONIAN AEONOLOGY."

<br />
<p>Of course no Diagram is anything more than a symbolical mnemonic, so
to
say; in itself it is entirely insufficient and only permits a glance at
one aspect, or face, of the world-process. It is a step in a ladder
merely, useful only for mounting and to be left aside when once a
higher
rung is reached. Thus it is that the whole of the elements of Euclid
were merely an introduction to the comprehension of the "Platonic
Solids," which must also, in their turn, be discarded when the within
or
essence of things has to be dealt with and not the without or
appearance, no matter how "typical" that appearance may be.</p>
<p>Sufficient has already been said of the Universal Principle, of the
Universal Root and of the Boundless Power&#8212;the Parabrahman (That Which
transcends Brahm&acirc;), M&ucirc;la-Prakriti (Root-Nature), and
Supreme &Icirc;shvara,
or the Unmanifested Eternal Logos, of the Ved&acirc;ntic Philosophers.
The
next stage is the potential unmanifested type of the Trinity, the Three
in One and One in Three, the Potentialities of Vishnu, Brahm&acirc;,
and
Shiva, the Preservative, Emanative, and Regenerative Powers&#8212;the Supreme
Logos, Universal Ideation and Potential Wisdom, called by Simon the
Incorruptible Form, Universal Mind and Great Thought. This
Incorruptible
Form is the Paradigm of all Forms, called Vishva R&ucirc;pam or
All-Form and
the Param R&ucirc;pam or Supreme Form, in the <i>Bhagavad
G&icirc;t&acirc;</i><a name="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122"><sup>[122]</sup></a>
spoken also
of as the Param Nidh&acirc;nam or Supreme Treasure-house,<a
 name="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123"><sup>[123]</sup></a>
which Simon
also calls the Treasure-house <span title="thaesauros" lang="el">&#952;&#951;&#963;&#945;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>
and Store-house
<span title="apothaekae" lang="el">&#945;&#960;&#959;&#952;&#951;&#954;&#951;</span>, an idea found in
many systems, and most elaborately
in that of the <i>Pistis-Sophia</i>.</p>
<p>Between this Divine World, the Unmanifested Triple Aeon, and the
World
of Men is the Middle Distance&#8212;the Waters of Space differentiated by the
Image or Reflection of the Triple Logos (D) brooding upon them. As
there
are three Worlds, the Divine, Middle, and Lower, which have been well
named by the Valentinians the Pneumatic (or Spiritual), Psychic (or
Soul-World), and Hylic (or Material), so in the Middle Distance we have
three planes or degrees, or even seven. This Middle Distance contains
the Invisible Spheres between the Physical World and the Divine. To it
the Initiated and Illuminati, the Spiritual Teachers of all ages, have
devoted much exposition and explanation. It is divine and infernal at
one and the same time, for as the higher parts&#8212;to use a phrase that is
clumsy and misleading, but which cannot be avoided&#8212;are pure and
spiritual, so the lower parts are corrupted and tainted. The law of
analogy, imaging and reflection, hold good in every department of
emanative nature, and though pure and spiritual ideas come to men from
this realm of the Middle Distance, it also receives back from man the
impressions of his impure thoughts and desires, so that its lower parts
are fouler even than the physical world, for man's secret thoughts and
passions are fouler than the deeds he performs. Thus there is a Heaven
and Hell in the Middle Distance, a Pneumatic and Hylic state.</p>
<p>The Lord of this Middle World is One in his own Aeon, but in reality
a
reflection of the triple radiance from the Unmanifested Logos. This
Lord
is the Manifested Logos, the Spirit moving on the Waters. Therefore all
its emanations or creations are triple. The triple Light above and the
triple Darkness below, force and matter, or spirit and matter, both
owing their being and apparent opposition to the Mind, "alone ordering
all things."</p>
<p>The Diagram to be more comprehensible should be so arranged,
mentally,
that each of the higher spheres is found within or interpenetrating the
lower. Thus, from this point of view, the centre is a more important
position than above or below. External to all is the Physical Universe,
made by the Hylic Angels, that is to say those emanated by Thought,
Epinoia, as representing Primeval Mother Earth, or Matter; not the
Earth
we know, but the Adamic Earth of the Philosophers, the Potencies of
Matter, which Eugenius Philalethes assures us, on his honour, no man
has
ever seen. This Earth is, in one sense, the Protyle for which the most
advanced of our modern Chemists are searching as the One Mother Element.</p>
<p>The idea of the Spirit of God moving on the Waters is a very
beautiful
one, and we find it worked out in much detail in the Hind&ucirc;
scriptures.
For instance, in the <i>Vishnu Pur&acirc;na</i>,<a name="FNanchor_124"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_124"><sup>[124]</sup></a> we find a description of the
emanation of the present Universe by the Supreme Spirit, at the
beginning of the present Kalpa or Aeon, an infinity of Kalpas and
Universes stretching behind. This he creates endowed with the Quality
of
Goodness, or the Pneumatic Potency. For the three Qualities (or Gunas)
of Nature (Prakriti) are the Pneumatic, Psychic and Hylic Potencies of
the Waters of Simon.</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>At the close of the past (or P&acirc;dma) Kalpa, the divine
Brahm&acirc;, endowed with the quality of goodness, awoke from his
night of sleep, and beheld the universe void. He, the supreme
N&acirc;r&acirc;yana, the incomprehensible, the sovereign of all
creatures, invested with the form of Brahm&acirc;, the god without
beginning, the creator of all things; of whom, with respect to his name
N&acirc;r&acirc;yana, the god who has the form of Brahm&acirc;, the
imperishable origin<a name="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a>
of the world, this verse is repeated: "The waters are called
N&acirc;r&acirc;, because they were the offspring of Nara (the supreme
spirit); and, as, in them, his first (Ayana)<a name="FNanchor_126"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a> progress (in the character
of Brahm&acirc;) took place, he is thence named N&acirc;r&acirc;yana
(he whose place of moving was the waters)."</p>
</div>
<p>Sir Wm. Jones translates this well-known verse of Manu<a
 name="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a>
as follows:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>The waters are called N&acirc;r&acirc;h, because they were the
production of Nara, or the spirit of God; and, since they were his
first Ayana, or place of motion, he thence is named
N&acirc;r&acirc;yana or moving on the waters.</p>
</div>
<p>Substantially the same statement is made in the <i>Linga, V&acirc;yu</i>,
and
<i>M&acirc;rkandeya Pur&acirc;nas</i>, and the <i>Bh&acirc;gavata</i>
explains it more fully as
follows:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>Purusha (the Spirit) having divided the egg (the ideal universe in
germ), on his issuing forth in the beginning, desiring a place of
motion (Ayanam) for himself, pure he created the waters pure.</p>
</div>
<p>In the <i>Vishnu Pur&acirc;na</i>, again, Brahm&acirc;, speaking to
the Celestials, says:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>I, Mah&acirc;deva (Shiva), and you all are but N&acirc;r&acirc;yana.<a
 name="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128"><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p>The beautiful symbol of the Divine Spirit moving and brooding over
the
Primordial Waters of Space&#8212;Waters which as differentiation proceeds
become more and more turbid&#8212;is too graphic to require further
explanation. It is too hallowed by age and sanctified by the consent of
humanity to meet with less than our highest admiration.</p>
<p>Dissertation on our Diagram could be pursued to almost any length,
but
sufficient has already been said to show the points of correspondence
between the ideas ascribed to Simon and universal Theosophy.</p>
<p>Let us now enquire into the part played by Epinoia, the Divine
Thought,
in the cosmic process, reserving the part played by her in the human
drama to when we come to treat of the soteriology of Simon. We have
evidently here a version of the great Sophia-mythus, which plays so
important a part in all Gnostic systems. On the one hand the
energizings
of the mother-side of Divine Nature, on the other the history of the
evolution of the Divine Monad, shut into all forms throughout the
elemental spheres, throughout the lower kingdoms, up to the man stage.</p>
<p>The mystery of Sophia-Epinoia is great indeed, insoluble in its
origins;
for how does that which is Divine descend below and create Powers which
imprison their parent? It is the mystery of the universe and of man,
insoluble for all but the Logos itself, by whose self-sacrifice Sophia,
the Soul, is finally freed from her bonds.</p>
<p>Epinoia is a Power of many names. She is called the Mother, or
All-Mother, Mother of the Living or Shining Mother, the Celestial Eve;
the Power Above; the Holy Spirit, for the Spiritus in some systems is a
feminine power (in a symbolical sense, of course), pre-eminently in the
<i>Codex Nazar&aelig;us</i>, the scripture of the Manda&iuml;tes. Again
she is called
She of the Left-hand, as opposed to the Christos, He of the Right-hand;
the Man-woman; Prouneikos; Matrix; Paradise; Eden; Acham&ocirc;th; the
Virgin;
Barbelo; Daughter of Light; Merciful Mother; Consort of the Masculine
One; Revelant of the Perfect Mysteries; Perfect Mercy; Revelant of the
Mysteries of the Whole Magnitude; Hidden Mother; She who knows the
Mysteries of the Elect; the Holy Dove, who has given birth to the two
Twins; Ennoia; and by many another name varying according to the
terminology of the different systems, but ever preserving the root idea
of the World-Soul in the Macrocosm and the Soul in Man.</p>
<p>Within every form, aye, even apparently the meanest, is Epinoia
confined; for everything within is innate with Life; every form
contains
a spark of the Divine Fire, essentially of the same nature as the All;
for in the Roots, and also in all things&#8212;since all is built on their
type&#8212;is "the whole of the Boundless Power together <i>in potentiality</i>,
but not <i>in actuality</i>."</p>
<p>The reason given for this imprisonment of Sophia in most of the
systems
is that she endeavoured to create without her Syzygy, the Father or
Nous, wishing to imitate alone the self-generating power of the
Supreme.
Thus through ignorance she involved herself in suffering, from which
she
was freed by repentance and experience. What explanation of this
supreme
mystery was publicly ventured on by Simon we cannot know, for the
patristic accounts are confused and contradictory.</p>
<p>Iren&aelig;us tells us that:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>She was the first Conception (Epinoia) of his Mind, the Mother of
All, by whom in the beginning he conceived in his Mind, the making of
the Angels and Archangels.</p>
<p> This Epinoia, leaping forth from <i>him</i> (the Boundless Power),
and knowing what was the will of her Father, descended to the Lower
Regions and generated the Angels and Powers, by whom also he said the
world was made. And after she had generated them, she was detained by
them through envy, for they did not wish to be thought the progeny of
another. As for himself he was entirely unknown by them; and it was his
Thought (Epinoia) that was made prisoner by the Powers and Angels that
had been emanated by her. And she suffered every kind of indignity at
their hands to prevent her re&auml;scending to her Father, even to
being imprisoned in the human body and transmigrating into other female
bodies, as from one vessel into another.</p>
</div>
<p>Tertullian's account differs by the important addition that the
"design
of the Father was prevented"; how or why he does not say.</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>She was his first Suggestion whereby he suggested the making of the
Angels and Archangels; that she sharing in this design had sprung forth
from the Father, and leaped down into the Lower Regions; and that
there, the design of the Father being prevented, she had brought forth
Angelic Powers ignorant of the Father, the artificer of this world (?);
by these she was detained, not according to his intention, lest when
she had gone they should be thought to be the progeny of another, etc.</p>
</div>
<p>The <i>Philosophumena</i> say nothing on this point, except that
Epinoia
"throws all the Powers in the World into confusion through her
unsurpassable Beauty."</p>
<p>Philaster renders confusion worse confounded, by writing:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>And he also dared to say that the World had been made by Angels, and
the Angels again had been made by certain endowed with perception from
Heaven, and that they (the Angels) had deceived the human race.</p>
<p> He asserted, moreover, that there was a certain other Thought
(Intellectus) who descended into the world for the salvation of men.</p>
</div>
<p>Epiphanius further complicates the problem as follows:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>This Power (Prun&icirc;cus and Holy Spirit) descending from Above
changed its form.... And through the Power from Above ... displaying
her beauty, she drove them to frenzy, and on this account was she sent
for the despoiling of the Rulers who brought the World into being; and
the Angels themselves went to war on her account; and while she
experienced nothing, they set to work to mutually slaughter each other
on account of the desire which she infused into them for herself.</p>
</div>
<p>Theodoret briefly follows Iren&aelig;us.</p>
<p>In these contradictory accounts we have a great confusion between
the
r&ocirc;les played by Nous and Epinoia, the Father and Thought, the
Spirit and
Spiritual Soul. Then again how did the Lower Regions come into
existence, for Epinoia to descend to them? This lacuna is filled by the
fuller information of the <i>Philosophumena</i> which shows us the
scheme of
self-emanation out or down into matter by similitude, thus confining
the
problem of "evil" to space and time, and not raising it into an eternal
principle. Naturally it is not to be supposed that the origin of "evil"
is solvable for man in his present state, therefore whether it was
according to the design or contrary to the design of the Father, will
ever depend upon the point of view from which we severally regard the
problem.</p>
<p>Law, Justice, and Compassion are not incompatible terms to one whose
heart is set firm on spiritual things; and the view that evil is not a
thing in itself, but exists only because of human ignorance, is one
that
must commend itself to the truly religious and philosophical mind. Thus
evil is not a fixed quantity in itself, it depends on the internal
attitude each man holds with regard to externals as to whether they are
evil or no.</p>
<p>For instance, it is not evil for an animal or savage to kill, for
the
light of the higher law is not yet flaming brightly in their hearts.
That only is evil if we do what is displeasing to the Self. This may
perhaps throw some light on the Simonian dogma of action by accident
(<i>ex accidenti</i>), or institution (<span title="thesei" lang="el">&#952;&#949;&#963;&#949;&#953;</span>),
as opposed to action
according to nature (<i>naturaliter</i> or <span title="phusei"
 lang="el">&#966;&#965;&#963;&#949;&#953;</span>)&#8212;evidently the
same idea as the teaching of Heracleitus to act according to nature
(<span title="kata phusin" lang="el">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#966;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span>) which he
explains as according to the
Unmanifested Harmony which we can hear by straining our ears to catch
that still small voice within, the Voice of the Silence, the Logos or
Self. Simon presumably refers to this in the phrase "the things which
sound within" (<span title="ta enaecha" lang="el">&#964;&#945; &#949;&#957;&#951;&#967;&#945;</span>), an
idea remarkably confirmed by
Psellus,<a name="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129"><sup>[129]</sup></a>
who quotes the following Logion:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>When thou seest a most holy, formless Fire shining and bounding
throughout the depths of the whole Cosmos, give ear to the Voice of the
Fire.</p>
</div>
<p>This brings us to a consideration of the teachings of Simon with
regard
to the Lesser World, the Microcosm, Man, and to the scheme of his
soteriology. Evidently Simon taught the ancient, immemorial doctrine
that the Microcosm Man was the Mirror and Potentiality of the Cosmos,
the Macrocosm, as we have already seen above. Whatever was true of the
emanation of the Universe, was also true of Man, whatever was true of
the Macrocosmic Aeons was true of the Microcosmic Aeons in Man, which
are potentially the same as those of the Cosmos, and will develop into
the power and grandeur of the latter, if they can find suitable
expression, or a fit vehicle. This view will explain the reason of the
ancients for saying that we could only perceive that of which we have a
germ already within us. Thus it is that Empedocles taught:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>By earth earth we perceive; by water, water; by aether, aether;
fire, by destructive fire; by friendship, friendship; and strife by
bitter strife.</p>
</div>
<p>And if the potentiality of all resided in every man, the teaching on
this point most forcibly has been, <i>Qui se cognoscit, in se omnia
cognoscit</i>&#8212;He who knows himself, knows all in himself&#8212;as Q. Fabius
Pictor tells us. And, therefore, the essential of moral and spiritual
training in ancient times was the attainment of Self-Knowledge&#8212;that is
to say, the attainment of the certitude that there is a divine nature
within every man, which is of infinite capacity to absorb universal
Wisdom; that, in brief, Man was <i>essentially</i> one with Deity.</p>
<p>With Simon, as with the Hermetic philosophers of ancient Egypt, all
things were interrelated by correspondence, analogy, and similitude.
"As above, so below," is the teaching on the Smaragdine Table of
Hermes. Therefore, whatever happened to the divine Epinoia, the Supreme
Mother, among the Aeons, happened also to the human Spiritual Soul or
Monadic Essence, in its evolution through all stages of manifestation.
This Soul is shut into all forms and bodies, successively up to the
stage of man.</p>
<p>From one point of view this teaching has been conclusively proved by
Modern Science. The evolution of the external form has been traced
throughout all the kingdoms and is no longer in question. The ancient
teachers of evolution, though less exact in detail, were more accurate
in fact, in postulating a "something within" which alone could make the
external evolution of form of any intelligible purpose. The Spiritual
Soul&#8212;the Life, Consciousness, Spirit, Intelligence, whatever we may
choose to call it&#8212;was formless in itself, but ever assuming new forms
by a process called metempsychosis, metasomatosis, metangismos, etc.,
which in the human stage becomes re&iuml;ncarnation, the rebirth or
Punarjanman of the Hind&ucirc;s.</p>
<p>So much has been written on metempsychosis and re&iuml;ncarnation of
late
that it is hardly necessary to dwell on a now so familiar idea. In its
widest sense the whole process of nature is subject to this mode of
existence, and in its more restricted sense it is the path of
pilgrimage
of the Soul in the desert of Matter. In treating of a philosophical
conception, which has already been completely established as far as its
"visible side" is concerned by the researches of Modern Science in the
field of evolution, it is a waste of time to obscure the main issue by
a
rehashing of the superstitious belief that the human Soul might pass
back to the brute. It may be that this superstition arose from the
consideration that the body and lower vestures of the Soul were shed
off
and gradually absorbed by the lower creation in the alchemical
processes
of nature. This was the fate of the "Purgations" of the Soul, but the
Soul itself when once it had passed from bodies of the lower kingdoms,
to bodies in the man-stage, could not retrogress beyond the limits of
that human kingdom.</p>
<p>By a glance at the Diagram, and regarding it from the microcosmic
point
of view, it is easy to see that the inner nature of man is more complex
than the elementary trichotomy of Body, Soul, and Spirit, might lead us
to suppose. Each plane of Being, for which the Soul has its own
appropriate Vesture, is generated from an "indivisible point," as Simon
called it, a zero-point, to use a term of modern Chemistry; six of
which
are shown in the Diagram, and each plane of Being is bounded by such
zero-points, for they are points like that of the Circle whose centre
is
everywhere and circumference nowhere.</p>
<p>To pass on to the soteriology of Simon. The general concept of this
presents no difficulty to the student of Eastern Religions. The idea
that the great teachers are Avat&acirc;ras, incarnations, or descents,
of the
Supreme Being, appearing on earth to aid mankind, is simple enough to
comprehend in itself, and would be open to little objection, were it
not
for the theological dogmas and mythological legends that are wont to be
so busily woven round the lives of such teachers. In the present age it
is hardly necessary for us, with the experience of the past before our
eyes, to raise dissension as to whether such a manifestation is
entirely
divine, or entirely human, or perfectly human and divine at one and the
same time, or neither or all of these. </p>
<p>Eastern philosophy, regarding not only the external phenomenal world
as
ever-changing and impermanent, but also all appearance or
manifestation&#8212;no matter how subjective it may be to us now&#8212;as not the
one Truth in itself, which it claims alone to be without change, it is
easy to see the reason why the Gnostic Philosophers for the most part
held to Doceticism&#8212;that is to say that the body of a Saviour was not
the Saviour himself, but an appearance. The heat of polemical
controversy may have led to exaggerated views on both sides, but the
philosophical mind will not be distressed at the thought that the body
is an appearance or mask of the real man, and that it forms no part of
his eternal possession. None the less the body is real to us here, for
we all have bodies of a like nature, and appearances are real to
appearances. Yet this does not invalidate the further consideration
that
there are other bodies, vestures, or vehicles of consciousness, besides
the gross physical "coat of skin," for the use of the spiritual man,
each being an "appearance" in comparison to the higher vehicle, which
is
in its turn an "appearance" to that which is more subtle and less
material or substantial than itself.</p>
<p>Thus, in the descent from the Divine World, the Soul transforms
itself,
or clothes itself in forms, or bodies, or vestures, which it weaves out
of its own substance, like to the Powers of the Worlds it passes
through, for every Soul has a different vehicle of consciousness for
every World or Plane.</p>
<p>But the doctrine of the Soter, or Saviour, does not apply until the
Christ-stage or consummation is reached. Following the idea of rebirth,
there is a spiritual life cycle, or life-thread, on which the various
earth-lives are strung, as beads on a necklace, each successive life
being purer and nobler, as the Soul gains control of matter, or the
driver control of the chariot and steeds that speed him through the
experiences of life. As the end of this great cycle approaches, an
earthly vehicle is evolved that can show forth the divine spirit in all
the fulness possible to this world or phase of evolution.</p>
<p>Now as the problem can be viewed from either the internal or
external
point of view, we have the mystery of the Soul depicted both from the
side of the involution of spirit into matter and of the evolution of
matter into spirit. If, on the one hand, we insist too strongly on one
view, we shall only have a one-sided conception of the process; if, on
the other, we neglect one factor, we shall never solve the at present
unknown quantity of the equation. Thus the Soul is represented as the
"lost sheep" struggling in the meshes of the net of matter, passing
from
body to body, and the Spirit is represented as descending, transforming
itself through the spheres, in order to finally rescue its Syzygy from
the bonds that are about her.</p>
<p>The Soul aspires to the Spirit and the Spirit takes thought for the
Soul; as the Simonians expressed it:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>The male (Heaven, i.e., the Nous or Christ, or Spiritual Soul) looks
down from above and takes thought for its co-partner (or Syzygy); while
the Earth (i.e., the Epinoia or Jesus, or Human Soul) from below
receives from the Heaven the intellectual (in the spiritual and
philosophical sense, of course) fruits that come down to it and are
cognate with the Earth (i.e., of the same nature essentially as
Epinoia, who is essentially one with Nous).</p>
</div>
<p>When this mystery is represented dramatically, so to say, and
personified, these two aspects of the Soul are depicted as two persons.
Thus we have Simon and Helen, his favourite disciple, Krishna and
Arjuna, etc. In the Canonical Gospels the favourite disciple is said to
be John, and the women-disciples are placed well in the background.
In the Gnostic Gospels, however, the women-disciples are not so
ostracized, and the view taken by these early communities of
philosophical and mystical Christians throws much light on that
wonderful history of the Magdalene that has so touched the heart of
Christendom. For instance, in the <i>Pistis-Sophia</i>, the chief of
all the
disciples, the most spiritual and intuitive, is Mary Magdalene. This is
not without significance when we remember the love of the Christ for
Mary "out of whom he had cast <i>seven</i> devils."</p>
<p>The allegory is a striking one, and perfectly comprehensible to the
student of comparative religion. As there are seven Aeons in the
Spiritual World, seven principles or aspects of the Spiritual Soul, so
here on Earth, by analogy, there are seven lower aspects, or impure
reflections. As there are seven Cardinal Virtues, the
Prajn&acirc;-P&acirc;ramit&acirc;s,
or Perfections of Wisdom, of the Buddhists, so there are seven Cardinal
Vices, and these must be cast out by the spiritual will, before the
repentant Mary, or Human Soul, can be purified.</p>
<p>This is the mystery of the Helen, the "lost sheep." Then follows the
mystical marriage of the Lamb, the union of the Human and Spiritual
Soul
in man, referred to so often in the Gospels and other mystical
scriptures.</p>
<p>Naturally the language used is symbolical, and has naught to do with
sex, in any sense. Woe unto him or her who takes these allegories of
the
Soul as literal histories, for nothing but sorrow will follow such
materialization of divine mysteries. If Simon or his followers fell
into
this error, they worked their own downfall, under the Great Law, as
surely do all who forge such bonds of matter for their own enslavement.</p>
<p>But with condemnation we have nothing to do; they alone who are
without
sin have the <i>right</i> to cast stones at the Magdalenes of this
world; and
they who are truly without sin use their purity to cleanse their
fellows, and do not sully it with the stains of self-righteous
condemnation. We, ordinary men and women of the age, are all "lost
sheep," human souls struggling in ignorance; shall we then stone our
fellows because their theology has a different nomenclature to our own?
For man was the same in the past as he is to-day. The Human Soul has
ever the same hopes and fears, loves and hates, passions and
aspirations, no matter how the mere form of their expression differs.
That which is important is the attitude we hold to the forms with which
we are surrounded. To-day the form of our belief is changed; the
fashion
of our dress is scientific and not allegorical, but are we any nearer
the realization that it is a dress and no more, and not the real
expression of the true man within?</p>
<p>Let us now take a brief glance at the Symbolical Tree of Life, which
plays so important a part in the Simonian Gn&ocirc;sis. Not, however,
that it
was peculiar to this system, for several of the schools use the same
symbology. For instance, in the <i>Pistis-Sophia</i><a
 name="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a>
the idea is
immensely expanded, and there is much said of an Aeonian Hierarchy
called the Five Trees. As this, however, may have been a later
development, let us turn to the ancient Hind&ucirc; Sh&acirc;stras, and
select one
out of the many passages that could be adduced, descriptive of the
Ashvattha Tree, the Tree of Life, "the Ashvattha of golden wings,"
where
the bird-souls get their wings and fly away happily, as the
<i>Sanatsuj&aacute;t&icirc;ya</i> tells us. The passage we choose is
from the <i>Bhagavad
G&icirc;t&acirc;</i>, that marvellous philosophical episode from the <i>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</i>,
which from internal evidence, and at the very lowest estimate, must be
placed at a date anterior to Simon. At the beginning of the fifteenth
Ady&acirc;ya we read:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>They say the imperishable Ashvattha is with root above and branches
below, of which the sacred hymns are the leaves. Who knows this, he is
a knower of knowledge. Upwards and downwards stretch its branches,
expanded by the potencies (Gunas); the sense-objects are its sprouts.
Downwards, too, its roots are stretched, constraining to action in the
world of men. Here neither its form is comprehended, nor its end, nor
beginning, nor its support. Having cut with the firm sword of
detachment (<i>sc.</i> non-attachment to the fruit of action) this
Ashvattha, with its overgrown roots, then should he (the disciple)
search out that Supreme whither they who come never return again, (with
the thought) that now he is come to that primal Being, whence the
evolution of old was emanated.</p>
</div>
<p>For what is this "sword of detachment" but another aspect of the
"fiery
sword" of Simon, which is turned about to guard the way to the Tree of
Life? This "sword" is our passions and desires, which now keep us from
the golden-leaved Tree of Life, whence we may find wings to carry us to
the "Father in Heaven." For once we have conquered Desire and turned it
into spiritual Will, it then becomes the "Sword of Knowledge"; and the
way to the Tree of Spiritual Life being gained, the purified Life
becomes the "Wings of the Great Bird" on which we mount, to be carried
to its Nest, where peace at last is found.</p>
<p>The simile of the Tree is used in many senses, not the least
important
of which is that of the heavenly "vine" of the re&iuml;ncarnating Soul,
every
"life" of which is a branch. This explains Simon's citation of the
Logion so familiar to us in the <i>Gospel according to Luke</i>:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>Every tree not bearing good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.</p>
</div>
<p>This also explains one of the inner meanings of the wonderful
passage in
the <i>Gospel according to John</i>:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>I am the true vine and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in
me that beareth not fruit he taketh away; and every branch that beareth
fruit he purgeth it that it may bear more fruit.<a name="FNanchor_131"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p>For only the spiritual fruit of every life is harvested in the
"Store-house" of the Divine Soul; the rest is shed off to be purified
in
the "Fire" of earthly existence.</p>
<p>Into the correspondence between the world-process of Nature, and
that
which takes place in the womb of mortal woman, it will not be necessary
to enter at length. No doubt Simon taught many other correspondences
between the processes of Cosmic Nature and Microcosmic Man, but what
were the details of this teaching we can in no way be certain. Simon
may have made mistakes in physiology, according to our present
knowledge, but with the evidence before us all we can do is to suspend
our judgment. For in the first place, we do not know that he has been
correctly reported by his patristic antagonists, and, in the second, we
are even yet too ignorant of the process of the nourishment of the
foetus to pronounce any <i>ex cathedr&acirc;</i> statement. In any
case Simon's
explanation is more in agreement with Modern Science than the
generality
of the phantasies on scientific subjects to which the uninstructed
piety
of the early Fathers so readily lent itself. As to whether the
Initiated of the ancients did or did not know of the circulation of the
blood and the functions of the arterial system, we must remain in
doubt,
for both their well known method of concealing their knowledge and also
the absence of texts which may yet be discovered by the industry of
modern exploration teach us to hold our judgment in suspense.</p>
<p>Again, seeing the importance which the symbolical Tree played in the
Simonian System, it may be that there was an esoteric teaching in the
school, which pointed out correspondences in the human body for
mystical
purposes, as has been the custom for long ages in India in the Science
of Yoga. In the human body are <i>at least</i> two "Trees," the
nervous, and
vascular systems. The former has its "root" above in the cerebrum, the
latter has its roots in the heart. Along the trunks and branches run
currents of "nervous ether" and "life" respectively, and the Science of
Yoga teaches its disciples to use both of these forces for mystical
purposes. It is highly probable also that the Gnostics taught the same
processes to their pupils, as we know for a fact that the
Neo-Platonists
inculcated like practices. From these considerations, then, it may be
supposed that Simon was not so ignorant of the real laws of the
circulation of the blood as might otherwise be imagined; and as to the
nourishment of the embryo, modern authorities are at loggerheads, the
majority, however, inclining to the opinion of Simon, that the foetus
is nourished through the umbilical cord.<a name="FNanchor_132"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_132"><sup>[132]</sup></a></p>
<p>The last point of importance to detain us, before passing on to a
notice
on the magical practices ascribed to Simon, is the allegorical use made
by the Simonians of Scripture. Here again we have little to do with the
details reported, but only with the idea. It was a common belief of the
sages of antiquity that the mythological part of the sacred writings of
the nations were to be understood in an allegorical fashion. Not to
speak of India, we have the Neo-Platonic School with its analogetical
methods of interpretation, and the mention of a work of Porphyry in
which an allegorical interpretation of the <i>Iliad</i> was attempted.
Allegorical shows of a similar nature also were enacted in the Lesser
Mysteries and explained in the Greater, as Julian tells us in the
<i>Mother of the Gods</i>,<a name="FNanchor_133"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_133"><sup>[133]</sup></a> and Plutarch on the <i>Cessation
of
Oracles</i>.<a name="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a></p>
<p>Much evidence could be adduced that this was a widespread idea held
by
the learned of antiquity, but space does not here allow a full
treatment of the subject. What is important to note is that Simon
claimed this as a method of his School, and therefore, in dealing with
his system, we cannot leave out so important a factor, and persist in
taking allegorical and symbolical expressions as literal teachings. We
may say that the method is misleading and has led to much superstition
among the ignorant, but we have no right to criticize the literal and
historical meaning of an allegory, and then fancy that we have
criticized the doctrine it enshrines. This has been the error of all
rationalistic critics of the world bibles. They have wilfully set on
one
side the whole method of ancient religious teaching, and taken as
literal history and narrative what was essentially allegorical and
symbolical. Perhaps the reason for this may be in the fact that
wherever
religion decays and ignorance spreads herself, there the symbolical and
allegorical is materialized into the historical and literal. The spirit
is forgotten, the letter is deified. Hence the re&auml;ction of the
rationalistic critic against the materialism and literalism of sacred
verities. Nevertheless, such criticism does not go deep enough to
affect
the real truths of religion and the convictions of the human soul, any
more than an aesthetic criticism on the shape of the Roman letters and
Arabic figures can affect the truth of an algebraical formula.
Rationalistic criticism may stir people from literalism and dogmatic
crystallization, in fact it has done much in this way, but it does not
reach the hidden doctrines.</p>
<p>Now Simon contended that many of the narrations of Scripture were
allegorical, and opposed those who held to the dead-letter
interpretation. To the student of comparative religion, it is difficult
to see what is so highly blameworthy in this. On the contrary, this
view
is so worthy of praise, that it deserves to be widely adopted to-day,
at
the latter end of the nineteenth century. To understand antiquity, we
must follow the methods of the wise among the ancients, and the method
of allegory and parable was the manner of teaching of the great Masters
of the past.</p>
<p>But supposing we grant this, and admit that all Scriptures possess
an
inner meaning and lend themselves to interpretation on every plane of
being and thought, who is to decide whether any particular
interpretation is just or no? Already we have writers arising, giving
diametrically opposite interpretations of the same mystical narrative,
and though this may be an advance on bald physical literalism, it is by
no means encouraging to the instructed and philosophical mind.</p>
<p>If the Deity is no respecter of persons, times, or nations, and if
no
age is left without witness of the Divine, it would seem to be in
accordance with the fitness of things that all religions in their
purity
are one in essence, no matter how overgrown with error they may have
become through the ignorance of man. If, again, the root of true
Religion is one, and the nature of the Soul and of the inner
constitution of things is identical in all climes and times, as far as
its <i>main features</i> are concerned, no matter what terminology,
allegory,
and symbology may be employed to describe it; and not only this, but if
it be true that such subjective things are as potent facts in human
consciousness as any that exist, as indeed is evidenced by the
unrivalled influence such things have had on human hearts and actions
throughout the history of the world&#8212;then we must consider that an
interpretation that fits only one system and is found entirely
unsuitable to the rest, is no part of universal religion, and is due
rather to the ingenuity of the interpreter than to a discovery of any
law of subjective nature. The method of comparative religion alone can
give us any certainty of correct interpretation, and a refusal to
institute such a comparison should invalidate the reliability of all
such enquiries.</p>
<p>Now Simon is reported to have endeavoured to find an inner meaning
in
scriptural narratives and mythologies, and against this method we can
have nothing to say; it is only when a man twists the interpretation to
suit his own prejudices that danger arises. Simon, however, is shown to
have appealed to the various sacred literatures known in his time, an
eclectic and theosophical method, and one that cannot very well be
longer set on one side even in our own days.</p>
<p>The primitive church was not so forgetful of symbology as are the
majority of the Christian faith to-day. One of the commonest
representations of primitive Christian art was that of the "Four
Rivers." As the Rev. Professor Cheetham tells us:</p>
<div class="blkquot">
<p>We find it repeated over and over again in the catacombs, either in
frescoes or in the sculptured ornaments of sarcophagi, and sometimes on
the bottoms of glass cups which have been discovered therein.<a
 name="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135"><sup>[135]</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p>The interpretations given by the early divines were many and
various; in
nearly every case, however, it was an interpretation which applied to
the Christian system alone, and accentuated external differences.
Little
attempt was made to find an interpretation in nature, either objective
or subjective, or in man. Simon, at any rate, made the attempt&#8212;an
effort to broaden out into a universal system applying to all men at
all
times. This is also the real spirit of pure Christianity which is so
often over-clouded by theological partisanship. A true interpretation
must stand the test of not only religious aspiration, but also
philosophical thought and scientific observation.</p>
<p>Nor again should we find cause to grieve at an attempted
interpretation
of the Trojan Horse, that was fabricated by the advice of Athena
(Minerva-Epinoia), for did not George Stanley Faber, in the early years
of this century, labour with much learning to prove its identity with
the Ark. True he only turned similar myths into the terms of one myth
and got no further, but that was an advance on his immediate
predecessors. Simon, however, had centuries before gone further than
Faber, as far as theory is concerned, by seeking an interpretation in
nature. But, in his turn, as far as our records go, he only attempted
the interpretation of one aspect of this graphic symbol, saying that it
typified "ignorance." An interpretation, however, to be complete should
cover all planes of consciousness and being from the physical human
plane to the divine cosmic. The Ark floating on the Waters of the
Deluge
and containing the Germs of Life, the Mundane Egg in the Waters of
Space, and the Mare with her freight of armed warriors, all typify a
great fact in nature, which may be studied scientifically in the
development of the germ-cell, and ethically by analogy, as the egg of
ignorance, the germs in which are, from the lower aspect, our own evil
passions.</p>
<p>In speaking of such allegories and tracing the correspondences
between
certain symbologies and the natural facts of embryology, Simon speaks
of
the "cave" which plays so important a part in so many religious
allegories. As the child is born in a "cave," so the "new man" is also
born in a "cave," and all the Saviours are so recorded to have been
born
in their birth legends. The Mysteries of antiquity were for the most
part solemnized in caves, or rock-cut temples. The Epopt&aelig; deemed
such
caverns as symbols both of the physical world and Hades or the Unseen
World, which surrounds every child of man. Into such a cave, in the
middle of the Ocean, Cronus shut his children, as Porphyry<a
 name="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a>
tells
us. It was called by the name Petra, or Rock, and from such a Rock
Mithras is said to have been born.<a name="FNanchor_137"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_137"><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>
<p>Faber endeavours to identify this symbolical cave with the Ark,<a
 name="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138"><sup>[138]</sup></a>
which may be permissible from one aspect, as the womb of mother nature
and of the human mother correspond analogically.</p>
<p>In the "new birth" of the mysteries, the Souls were typified as bees
born from the body of an ox, for they were to gather the honey of
wisdom, and were born from the now dead body of their lower natures. In
the cave were two doors, one for immortals, the other for mortals. In
this connection the cave is the psychic womb that surrounds every man,
of which Nicodemus displays such ignorance in the Gospels. It is the
microcosmic Middle Distance; by one door the Lower Soul enters, and
uniting with its immortal consort, who descends through the door of the
immortals, becomes immortal.</p>
<p>The cavern is overshadowed by an olive tree&#8212;again the Tree of Life
to
which we have referred above&#8212;on the branches of which the doves rest,
and bring back the leaves to the ark of the body and the prisoner
within
it.</p>
<p>But space does not permit us to pursue further this interesting
subject,
which requires an entire treatise by itself, or even a series of
volumes. Enough, however, has been said to show that the method of
interpretation employed by Simon is not without interest and profit,
and
that the tolerant spirit of to-day which animates the best minds and
hearts in Christendom will find no reason to mete out to Simon
wholesale
condemnation on this score.</p>
<p>There are also many other points of interest that could be
elaborated
upon, in the fragments of the system we are reviewing, but as my task
is
in the form of an essay, and not an exhaustive work, I must be content
to pass them by for the present, and to hurry on to a few words on that
strange and misunderstood subject, commonly known as Magic.</p>
<p>What Magic, the "Great Art" of the ancients, was in reality is now
as
difficult to discover as is the true Religion that underlies all the
great religions of the world. It was an art, a practice, the Great and
Supreme Art of the most Sacred Science of God, the Universe and Man. It
was and it is all this in its highest sense, and its method was what is
now called "creation." As the Aeons imitated the Boundless Power and
emanated or created in their turn, so could man imitate the Aeons and
emanate or create in his turn. But "creation" is not generation, it is
a
work of the "mind," in the highest sense of the word. By purification
and aspiration, by prayer and fasting, man had to make his mind
harmonious with the Great Mind of the Universe, and so by imitation
create pure vehicles whereby his consciousness could be carried in
every direction of the Universe. Such spiritual operations required the
greatest purity and piety, real purity and true piety, without disguise
or subterfuge, for man had to face himself and his God, before whom no
disguise was possible. The most secret motives, the most hidden
desires,
were revealed by the stern self-discipline to which the Adepts of the
Science subjected themselves.</p>
<p>But as in all things here below, so with the Art of Magic, it was
two-fold. Above I have only spoken of the bright side of it, the path
along which the World-Saviours have trodden, for no one can gain
entrance to the path of self-sacrifice and compassion unless his heart
burns with love for all that lives, and unless he treads the way of
wisdom only in order that he may become that Path itself for the
salvation of the race. But there is the other side; knowledge is
knowledge irrespective of the use to which it may be put. The sword of
knowledge is two-edged, as remarked above, and may be put to good or
evil use, according to the selfishness or unselfishness of the
possessor.</p>
<p>But <i>corruptio optimi pessima</i>, and as the employment of
wisdom for the
benefit of mankind&#8212;as, for instance, curing the sick, physically and
morally&#8212;is the highest, so the use of any abnormal power for the
advantage of self is the vilest sin that man can commit.</p>
<p>There are strange analogies in Nature, and the higher the spiritual,
the
lower the corresponding material process; so that we find in the
history
of magic&#8212;perhaps the longest history in the world&#8212;extremes ever
meeting. Abuse of spiritual powers, and the vilest physical processes,
noxious, fantastic, and pestilential, are recorded in the pages of
so-called magical literature, but such foul deeds are no more real
Magic
than are the horrors of religious fanaticism the outcome of true
Mohammedanism or Christianity. This is the abuse, the superstition, the
degeneration of all that is good and true, rendered all the more vile
because it pertains to denser planes of matter than even the physical.
It is a strange thing that the highest should pair with the lowest
where
man is concerned, but it ever remains true that the higher we climb the
lower we may fall.</p>
<p>Man is much the same in nature at all times, and though the Art was
practised in its purity by the great World-Teachers and their immediate
followers, whether we call it by the name Magic or no, it ever fell
into abuse and degeneracy owing to the ingrained ignorance and
selfishness of man. Thus the Deity and Gods or Daemons of one nation
became the Devil and Demons of another; the names were changed, the
facts remained the same. For if we are to reject all such things as
superstition, hallucination, and what not, the good must go with the
bad. But facts, whether good or bad, are still facts, and man is still
man, no matter how he changes the fashion of his belief. The followers
of the World-Teachers cannot hold to the so-called "miracles" of their
respective Masters and reject all others as false in fact, no matter
from what source they may believe they emanate. In nature there can be
nothing supernatural, and as man stands mid-way between the divine and
infernal, if we accept the energizing of the one side of his nature, we
must also accept that of the other. Both are founded on nature and
science, both are under law and order.</p>
<p>The great Master of Christendom is reported to have told his
disciples
that if they had but faith they should do greater works than even he
had
done. Either this was false or else the followers have been false to
their Teacher. There is no escape from the dilemma. And such "works"
are
to be wrought by divine Magic alone, or if the term be disliked, by
whatever name the great Science of the Soul and Divine things may be
called.</p>
<p>For the last two hundred years or so it has been the fashion to
deride
all such matters, perhaps owing to a re&auml;ction against
over-credulity on
the part of those who held to the letter of the law and forgot its
spirit; but to-day it is no longer possible to entirely set aside this
all-important part of man's nature, and it now calls for as strict a
scientific treatment as the facts of the physical universe have been
subjected to.</p>
<p>Hypnotism, Mesmerism, Spiritualism and Psychical Research, are the
cloud no bigger than a man's hand that is forcing the facts of Magic
again on the attention of both the theological and scientific world.
Hypnotism and Psychical Research are already becoming respectable and
attracting the attention of the generality of men of science and of our
clergy. Spiritualism and Mesmerism are still tabooed, but wait their
turn for popular recognition, having already been recognized by
pioneers
distinguished in science and other professions.</p>
<p>Of course I speak only of the facts of these arts, I do not speak of
the
theories put forward.</p>
<p>All these processes are in the very outermost court of the Temple of
True Magic, even if they are not outside the precinct. But they are
sufficient for our purpose, and should make the serious thinker and
unprejudiced enquirer pause before pronouncing the words, superstition
and hallucination, in too confident a tone, for he now must see the
necessity of having a clear idea of what he means by the terms.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon of late to hear the superficially instructed
setting
down everything to "suggestion," a word they have picked up from modern
hypnotic research, or "telepathy," a name invented by psychical
research&#8212;the ideas being as old as the world&#8212;forgetting that their
mind remains in precisely the same attitude with regard to such matters
as it was in previously when they utterly denied the possibility of
suggestion and telepathy. But to the earnest and patient student
hypnotism and the rest are but the public re&auml;ppearance of what has
always existed in spite of the denial of two hundred years or so, and
instead of covering the whole ground is but the forward spray from the
returning wave of psychism which will sweep the nations off their feet
and moral balance, if they will not turn to the experience of the past
and gain strength to withstand the inrush.</p>
<p>The higher forms of all these things, in the Western World, should
have
now been in the hands of the ministers of the Church, in which case we
should not have had the re&auml;ppearance of such powers in the hands
of
vulgar stage exhibitions and mercenary public mediumship.</p>
<p>But so it is; and in vain is it any longer to raise the cry of fraud
and
hallucination on the one hand and of the devil on the other. This is a
mere shirking of responsibility, and nothing but a reasonable
investigation and an insistence on the highest ideals of life will help
humanity.</p>
<p>I do not intend to enter into any review of the "wonders" attributed
to
Simon, neither to deny them as hallucinations, nor attribute them to
the
devil, nor explain them away by "suggestion." As a matter of fact we do
not even know whether Simon did or pretended to do any of the precise
things mentioned. All we are competent to decide is the general
question, viz., that any use of abnormal power is pernicious if done
for
a personal motive, and will assuredly, sooner or later, react on the
doer.</p>
<p>Here and there in the patristic accounts we light on a fact worthy
of
consideration, as, for example, when Simon is reported to have denied
that the real soul of a boy could be exorcised, and said that it was
only a daemon, in this case a sub-human intelligence or elemental, as
the Medi&aelig;val Kabalists called them. Again the Simonians are said
to have
expelled any from their Mysteries who worshipped the statues of Zeus or
Athena as being representatives of Simon and Helen; thus showing that
they were symbolical figures for some purpose other than ordinary
worship; and probably the sect in its purity possessed a body of
teaching which threw light on many of the religious practices of the
times, and gave them a rational interpretation, quite at variance with
the fantastic diabolism which the Fathers have so loudly charged
against
them.</p>
<p>The legends of magic are the same in all countries, fantastic enough
to
us in the nineteenth century, in all conscience, and most probably
exaggerated out of all correct resemblance to facts by the excited
imagination of the legend-tellers, but still it is not all imagination,
and after sifting out even ninety-nine per cent of rubbish, the residue
that remains is such vast evidence to the main facts that it is fairly
overwhelming, and deserves the investigation of every honest student.</p>
<p>But the study is beset with great difficulty, and if left in the
hands
of untrained thinkers, as are the majority of those who are interested
in such matters in the present day, will only result in a new phase of
credulity and superstition. And such a disastrous state of affairs will
be the distinct fault of the leaders of thought in the religious,
philosophical, and scientific world, if they refuse the task which is
naturally theirs, and if they are untrue to the responsibility of their
position as the directors, guardians, and adjusters of the popular
mind.
Denial is useless, mere condemnation is of small value, explanation
alone will meet the difficulty.</p>
<p>Thus when we are brought face to face with the recital of magical
wonders as attributed to Simon in the patristic legends, it is not
sufficient to sweep them on one side and ticket them with the
contemptuous label of "superstition." We must recognize that whether or
not these things were actually done by Simon, the ancient world both
Pagan and Christian firmly believed in their reality, and that if our
only attitude towards them is one of blank denial, we include in that
denial the possibility of the so-called "miracles" of Christianity and
other great religions, and therewith invalidate one of the most
important factors of religious thought and history. That the present
attitude of denial is owing to the absurd explanation of the phenomena
given by the majority of the ancient worthies, is easily admissible,
but
this is no reason why the denial of the possibilities of the existence
of such things should be logical or scientific.</p>
<p>As to the wonders ascribed to Simon, though extraordinary, they are
puerile compared to the ideals of the truly religious mind, and if
Simon used such marvels as proofs of the truth of his doctrine, he
unduly took advantage of the ignorance of the populace and was untrue
to
his better nature.</p>
<p>Again, setting aside all historical criticism, if Simon, as the <i>Acts</i>
report, thought to purchase spiritual powers with money, or that those
who were really in possession of such powers would ever sell them, we
can understand the righteous indignation of the apostles, though we
cannot understand their cursing a brother-man. The view of the
Christian
writer on this point is a true one, but the dogma that every operation
which is not done in the name of the particular Master of Christendom
is
of the Devil&#8212;or, to avoid personifications, is evil&#8212;can hardly find
favour with those who believe in the brotherhood of the whole race and
that Deity is one, no matter under what form worshipped.</p>
<p>Finally, to sum up the matter, we have cited our authorities, and
reviewed them, and then endeavoured to sift out what is good from the
heap, leaving the rubbish to its fate. Removed as we are by so many
centuries from the fierce strife of religious controversy which so
deeply marked the rise of Christianity, we can view the matter with
impartiality and seek to redress the errors that are patent both on the
side of orthodoxy and of heterodoxy. It is true we cannot be free of
the
past, but it is also true that to identify ourselves with the hates and
strifes of the ancients, is merely to retrogress from the path of
progress. On the contrary, our duty should be to identify ourselves
with
all that is good and beautiful and true in the past, and so gleaning it
together, bind it into a sheaf of corn that, when ground in the mills
of
common-sense and practical experience, may feed the millions of every
denomination who for the most part are starving on the unsatisfying
husks of crude dogmatism. There is no need for a new revelation, in
whatever sense the word is understood, but there is every need for an
explanation of the old revelations and the undeniable facts of human
experience. If the Augean stables of the materialism that is so
prevalent in the religion, philosophy and science of to-day, are to be
cleansed, the spiritual sources of the world-religions can alone be
effectual for their cleansing, but these are at present hidden by the
rocks and overgrowth of dogma and ignorance. And this overgrowth can
only be removed by explanation and investigation, and each who works at
the task is, consciously or unconsciously, in the train of the Hercules
who is pioneering the future of humanity.</p>

</p>
<p>The idea of this Crater is interestingly exemplified in the Twelfth
Book
of Hermes Trismegistus, called "His Crater, or Monas," as follows:
</p>
<p>"10. <i>Tat.</i> But wherefore, Father, did not God distribute the
Mind to
all men?
</p>
<p>"11. <i>Herm.</i> Because it pleased him, O Son, to set that in the
middle
among all souls, as a reward to strive for.
</p>
<p>"12. <i>Tat.</i> And where hath he set it?
</p>
<p>"13. <i>Herm.</i> Filling a large Cup or Bowl (Crater) therewith,
he sent it
down, giving also a Cryer or Proclaimer.
</p>
<p>"14. And he commanded him to proclaim these things to the souls of
men.
</p>
<p>"15. Dip and wash thyself, thou that art able, in this Cup or Bowl:
Thou
that believeth that thou shalt return to him that sent this cup; thou
that acknowledgest whereunto thou wert made.
</p>
<p>"16. As many, therefore, as understood the Proclamation, and were
<i>baptized</i>, or dowsed into the <i>Mind</i>, these were made
partakers of
knowledge, and became perfect men, receiving the Mind."
</p>
<p>This striking passage explains the mystic "Baptism of Fire," or
Mind,
whereby man became one with his Divine Monas, which is indeed his
"Mother Vortex" or Source.</p>

<p> The most advanced theory, however, is that the foetus
derives nourishment from the amniotic fluid, and Dr. Jerome A. Anderson
sums up his highly interesting paper on the "Nutrition of the Foetus"
in
the <i>American Journal of Obstetrics</i>, Vol. XXI, July, 1888, as
follows:
</p>
<p>"To briefly sum up the facts supporting amniotic nutrition:
</p>
<p>"1st. The constant presence of nutritive substances in the amniotic
fluid during the whole period of gestation.
</p>
<p>"2nd. The certainty of the absorption by a growing, almost skinless,
foetus of any nutritive material in which it is constantly bathed.
</p>
<p>"3rd. The permeability of the digestive tract at an early period,
and
the necessary entrance therein, according to the laws of hydrostatics,
of the albuminous amniotic fluid.
</p>
<p>"4th. The presence of, as it seems to me, <i>bon&acirc; fide</i>
d&eacute;bris of
digestion, or meconium, in the lower intestine.
</p>
<p>"5th. The presence of urine in the bladder, and bile in the upper
intestine; their normal locations.
</p>
<p>"6th. The mechanical difficulties opposing direct nutrition through
the
placenta, and the impossibility of nourishment by this method during
the
early stages of embryonic life previous to the formation of the
placenta
or umbilical vesicle.
</p>
<p>"7th. The evident material source of the fluid, as shown by the
hydrorrheas of pregnancy, as well as in the exhaustion the mother
experiences, in some cases, at least, under its loss and rapid
reproduction.
</p>
<p>"8th. The entire absence during gestation of any trace of the
placenta
in certain animals, notably the salamander."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
